description: High-technology exports are products with high R&D intensity, such as aerospace, computers,
  pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'The OECD has developed a four-way classification of exports: high, medium-high,
  medium-low and low-technology. The classification is based on the importance of expenditures on research
  and development relative to the gross output and value added of different types of industries that produce
  goods for export. Examples of high-technology industries are aircraft, computers, and pharmaceuticals;
  medium-high-technology includes motor vehicles, electrical equipment and most chemicals; medium-low-technology
  includes rubber, plastics, basic metals and ship construction; low-technology industries include food
  processing, textiles, clothing and footwear.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology products may
  also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade.
  The method takes only R&D intensity into account, but other characteristics of high technology are also
  important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents. Considering these
  characteristics would yield a different list (see Hatzichronoglou 1997). The indicator is based on data
  reported by countries to COMTRADE. The export values presented in the World Development Indicators represent
  Gross Exports less Re-Exports. The values may be impacted in cases of reporting errors or missing data,
  for example if countries do not report Re-Exports for one or more periods.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "High technology products are defined according to SITC Rev.4 as the
   sum of the following products: Aerospace, Computers-office machines, Electronics-telecommunications,
   Pharmacy, Scientific instruments, Electrical machinery, Chemistry, Non-electrical machinery, Armament.
   The following product codes are used: Aerospace: (714 \u2013 71489 -71499)+7921+7922+7924+7925+79291+79293+87411;
   Computers-office machines: 75194+75195+752+75997; Electronics-communication: 76331+7638+(764-76493-76499)+7722+77261+77318+77625+77627+7763+7764+7768+89844+89846;
   Pharmacy: 5413+5415+5416+5421+5422; Scientific instruments: 774+871+87211+(874-87411-8742)+88111+88121+88411+88419+(8996-89965-89969);
   Electrical machinery: (7786-77861-777866-77869)+7787+77884; Chemistry: 52222+52223+52229+52269+525+531+57433+591;

   Armament: 891\nThe list can also be accessed on the Eurostat website. This list, based on the OECD
   definition, contains technical products of which the manufacturing involved a high intensity of R&D.
   The original high-tech products classification is based on SITC Rev. 3 and is taken from Table 4 of
   Annex 2 of the 1997 working paper of Thomas Hatzichronouglou, OECD. In September 2019 the definition
   in the World Development Indicators database was updated to SITC Rev.4 from SITC Rev. 3.  The data
   are in current U.S. dollars and are sourced from the UN's Comtrade database."
