description: High-technology exports are products with high R&D intensity, such as in aerospace, computers,
  pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'The OECD has developed a four-way classification of exports: high, medium-high,
  medium-low and low-technology. The classification is based on the importance of expenditures on research
  and development relative to the gross output and value added of different types of industries that produce
  goods for export. Examples of high-technology industries are aircraft, computers, and pharmaceuticals;
  medium-high-technology includes motor vehicles, electrical equipment and most chemicals; medium-low-technology
  includes rubber, plastics, basic metals and ship construction; low-technology industries include food
  processing, textiles, clothing and footwear.


  Industries of high and medium-high-technology intensity account for over two-thirds of total OECD manufacturing
  exports. Differences among countries are substantial; the share of high and medium-high-technology industries
  ranges from over 80 percent in Japan and Ireland to less than 10 percent in Iceland. Technology exports
  have grown rapidly in Iceland, Turkey and the eastern European countries, although most of these countries,
  with Hungary and the Czech Republic as exceptions, still focus primarily on low and medium-low-technology
  exports.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology products may
  also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade.
  The method takes only R&D intensity into account, but other characteristics of high technology are also
  important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents. Considering these
  characteristics would yield a different list (see Hatzichronoglou 1997).

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The method for determining high-technology exports was developed by
  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in collaboration with Eurostat. It takes
  a "product approach" (rather than a "sectoral approach") based on R&D intensity (expenditure divided
  by total sales) for groups of products from Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the
  United States.


  The original high-tech products classification is based on SITC Rev. 3 and is taken from Table 4 of
  Annex 2 of the 1997 working paper of Thomas Hatzichronouglou, OECD. The methodology used to determine
  high-tech exports takes the "product approach" based on R&D intensity on products from Germany, Italy,
  Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States.
