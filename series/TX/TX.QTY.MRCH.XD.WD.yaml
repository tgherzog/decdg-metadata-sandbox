Topic: 'Private Sector & Trade: Trade indexes'
description: "Export volume indexes are derived from UNCTAD's volume index series and are the ratio of\
  \ the export value indexes to the corresponding unit value indexes. Unit value indexes are based on\
  \ data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented\
  \ by UNCTAD\u2019s estimates using the previous year\u2019s trade values at the Standard International\
  \ Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest\
  \ periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification\
  \ of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD\u2019s Commodity Price\
  \ Statistics, interna\xADtional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates\
  \ unit value indexes at the country level using the current year\u2019s trade values as weights. For\
  \ economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's\
  \ International Financial Statistics are used."
