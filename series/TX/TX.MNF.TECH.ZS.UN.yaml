Developmentrelevance: Industrial development generally entails a structural transition from resource-based
  and low technology activities to medium and high-tech industry (MHT) activities. A modern, highly complex
  production structure offers better opportunities for skills development and technological innovation.
  MHT activities are also the high value addition industries of manufacturing with higher technological
  intensity and labor productivity. Increasing the share of MHT sectors also reflects the impact of innovation.

  minus re-exports. Manufactured exports, is the sum of the four categories resource-based exports, low-tech
  exports, medium tech exports and high-tech exports; and medium-high technology exports, is the sum of
  medium tech exports and high-tech exports. The world value of manufacturing exports is the sum of all
  manufacturing net exports. For additional information please see Table B.2.1 in Appendix B of UNIDO
