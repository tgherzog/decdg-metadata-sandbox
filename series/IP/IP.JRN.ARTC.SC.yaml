Developmentrelevance: 'A scientific journal is a periodical publication intended to further the progress
  of science, usually by reporting new research. Most journals are highly specialized, although some of
  the oldest journals such as Nature publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific
  fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed. When a scientific journal
  describes experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher
  could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes
  part of the permanent scientific record.


  Some journals, such as Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United
  States of America (PNAS), and Physical Review Letters, have a reputation of publishing articles that
  mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Scientific and technical article counts are from journals classified by the
  Institute for Scientific Information''s Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index
  (SSCI). Counts are based on fractional assignments; articles with authors from different countries are
  allocated proportionately to each country. The SCI and SSCI databases cover the core set of scientific
  journals but may exclude some of local importance and may reflect some bias toward English-language
  journals.

  Articles are classified by year of publication and assigned to region/country/economy on basis of institutional
  address(es) listed on the article. Articles are counted on a fractional-count basis that is, for articles
  with collaborating institutions from multiple countries/economies, each country/economy receives fractional
  credit on basis of proportion of its participating institutions. Details may not add to total because
  of rounding.'
