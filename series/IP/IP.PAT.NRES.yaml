Developmentrelevance: 'The Patent Cooperation Treaty (www.wipo.int/pct) provides a two phase system for
  filing patent. International applications under the treaty provide for a national patent grant only
  - there is no international patent. The national filing represents the applicant''s seeking of patent
  protection for a given territory, whereas international filings, while representing a legal right, do
  not accurately reflect where patent protection is sought. Resident filings are those from residents
  of the country concerned. Nonresident filings are from applicants abroad. For regional offices applications
  from residents of any member state of the regional patent convention are considered nonresident filings.
  Some offices (notably the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) use the residence of the inventor rather
  than the applicant to classify filings.


  Patent data are a great resource for the study of technical change in a country or region. Patent data
  provide a uniquely detailed source of information on inventive activity and the multiple dimensions
  of the inventive process (e.g. geographical location, technical and institutional origin, individuals
  and networks). Furthermore, patent data form a consistent basis for comparisons across time and across
  countries.


  Patent data can be used in the analysis of a wide array of topics related to technical change and patenting
  activity including industry-science linkages, patenting strategies by companies, internationalization
  of research, and indicators on the value of patents. Patent-based statistics reflect the inventive performance
  of countries, regions and firms, as well as other aspects of the dynamics of the innovation process
  such as co-operation in innovation or technology paths.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'A patent is an exclusive right granted for a specified period (generally 20
  years) for a new way of doing something or a new technical solution to a problem - an invention. The
  invention must be of practical use and display a characteristic unknown in the existing body of knowledge
  in its field. Most countries have systems to protect patentable inventions.


  Unless otherwise stated, statistics on the number of resident and non-resident patent applications include
  those filed via the PCT system as PCT national/regional phase entries.'
Periodicity: Annual
Shortdefinition: Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation
  Treaty procedure or with a national patent office.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Non-resident patent applications are from applicants outside the relevant
  State or region. Patent data cover applications and grants classified by field of technology. International
  applications series distinguish four subcategories: a) patents taken out by residents of a country in
  that country; b) patents taken out in a country by non-residents of that country; c) total patents registered
  in the country or naming it; d) patents taken out outside a country by its residents. Data on patents
  granted only distinguish between patents awarded to residents and to non-residents. A patent provides
  protection for the invention to the owner of the patent for a limited period, generally 20 years.


  Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure
  or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention - a product or process that provides
  a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem.'
