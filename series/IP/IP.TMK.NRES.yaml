description: Trademark applications filed are applications to register a trademark with a national or
  regional Intellectual Property (IP) office. A trademark is a distinctive sign which identifies certain
  goods or services as those produced or provided by a specific person or enterprise. A trademark provides
  protection to the owner of the mark by ensuring the exclusive right to use it to identify goods or services,
  or to authorize another to use it in return for payment. The period of protection varies, but a trademark
  can be renewed indefinitely beyond the time limit on payment of additional fees. Direct nonresident
  trademark applications are those filed by applicants from abroad directly at a given national IP office.
