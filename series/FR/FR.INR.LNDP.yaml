description: Interest rate spread is the interest rate charged by banks on loans to private sector customers
  minus the interest rate paid by commercial or similar banks for demand, time, or savings deposits. The
  terms and conditions attached to these rates differ by country, however, limiting their comparability.
Aggregationmethod: Median
Developmentrelevance: Both banking and financial systems enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction.
  At low levels of economic development commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while
  at higher levels domestic stock markets tend to become more active and efficient. The size and mobility
  of international capital flows make it increasingly important to monitor the strength of financial systems.
  Robust financial systems can increase economic activity and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial
  activity and impose widespread costs on the economy.

Limitationsandexceptions: Countries use a variety of reporting formats, sample designs, interest compounding
  formulas, averaging methods, and data presentations for indices and other data series on interest rates.
  The IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual does not provide guidelines beyond the general recommendation
  that such data should reflect market prices and effective (rather than nominal) interest rates and should
  be representative of the financial assets and markets to be covered. For more information, please see

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The interest rate spread - the margin between the cost of mobilizing
  liabilities and the earnings on assets - measures financial sector efficiency in intermediation. A narrow
  spread means low transaction costs, which reduces the cost of funds for investment, crucial to economic
  growth.
