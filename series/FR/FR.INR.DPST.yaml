description: Deposit interest rate is the rate paid by commercial or similar banks for demand, time, or
  savings deposits. The terms and conditions attached to these rates differ by country, however, limiting
  their comparability.
Developmentrelevance: Both banking and financial systems enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction.
  At low levels of economic development commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while
  at higher levels domestic stock markets tend to become more active and efficient. The size and mobility
  of international capital flows make it increasingly important to monitor the strength of financial systems.
  Robust financial systems can increase economic activity and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial
  activity and impose widespread costs on the economy.

Limitationsandexceptions: Countries use a variety of reporting formats, sample designs, interest compounding
  formulas, averaging methods, and data presentations for indices and other data series on interest rates.
  The IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual does not provide guidelines beyond the general recommendation
  that such data should reflect market prices and effective (rather than nominal) interest rates and should
  be representative of the financial assets and markets to be covered. For more information, please see

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Many interest rates coexist in an economy, reflecting competitive conditions,
  the terms governing loans and deposits, and differences in the position and status of creditors and
  debtors. In some economies interest rates are set by regulation or administrative fiat. In economies
  with imperfect markets, or where reported nominal rates are not indicative of effective rates, it may
  be difficult to obtain data on interest rates that reflect actual market transactions. Deposit and lending
  rates are collected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as representative interest rates offered
  by banks to resident customers. The terms and conditions attached to these rates differ by country,
  however, limiting their comparability.


  In 2009 the IMF began publishing a new presentation of monetary statistics for countries that report
  data in accordance with its Monetary Financial Statistical Manual 2000. The presentation for countries
  that report data in accordance with its International Financial Statistics (IFS) remains the same.'
