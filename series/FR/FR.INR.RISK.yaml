description: Risk premium on lending is the interest rate charged by banks on loans to private sector
  customers minus the "risk free" treasury bill interest rate at which short-term government securities
  are issued or traded in the market. In some countries this spread may be negative, indicating that the
  market considers its best corporate clients to be lower risk than the government. The terms and conditions
  attached to lending rates differ by country, however, limiting their comparability.
Developmentrelevance: Both banking and financial systems enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction.
  At low levels of economic development commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while
  at higher levels domestic stock markets tend to become more active and efficient. The size and mobility
  of international capital flows make it increasingly important to monitor the strength of financial systems.
  Robust financial systems can increase economic activity and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial
  activity and impose widespread costs on the economy.

Limitationsandexceptions: Countries use a variety of reporting formats, sample designs, interest compounding
  formulas, averaging methods, and data presentations for indices and other data series on interest rates.
  The IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual does not provide guidelines beyond the general recommendation
  that such data should reflect market prices and effective (rather than nominal) interest rates and should
  be representative of the financial assets and markets to be covered. For more information, please see

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The risk premium on lending is the spread between the lending rate to
  the private sector and the "risk-free" government rate. Spreads are expressed as an annual average.
  A small spread indicates that the market considers its best corporate customers to be low risk; a negative
  value indicates that the market considers its best corporate clients to be lower risk than the government.
