Developmentrelevance: "External debt is that part of the total debt in a country that is owed to creditors\
  \ outside the country. The debtors can be the government, corporations or private households. The debt\
  \ includes money owed to private commercial banks, other governments, or international financial institutions.\n\
  \nExternal indebtedness affects a country's creditworthiness and investor perceptions. Nonreporting\
  \ countries might have outstanding debt with the World Bank, other international financial institutions,\
  \ or private creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries' ability to obtain foreign exchange\
  \ through exports of goods, services, primary income, and workers' remittances.\n\nDebt ratios are used\
  \ to assess the sustainability of a country's debt service obligations, but no absolute rules determine\
  \ what values are too high. Empirical analysis of developing countries' experience and debt service\
  \ performance shows that debt service difficulties become increasingly likely when the present value\
  \ of debt reaches 200 percent of exports. Still, what constitutes a sustainable debt burden varies by\
  \ country. Countries with fast-growing economies and exports are likely to be able to sustain higher\
  \ debt levels. Various indicators determine a sustainable level of external debt, including:\n\na) debt\
  \ to GDP ratio\nb) foreign debt to exports ratio\nc) government debt to current fiscal revenue ratio\
  \ \nd) share of foreign debt\ne) short-term debt\nf) concessional debt in the total debt stock"
Generalcomments: The denominator for this indicator in previous versions of Global Development Finance
  included workers' remittances. Workers' remittances are no longer included.

Shortdefinition: Total debt service to exports of goods, services and primary income. Total debt service
  is the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in currency, goods, or services on long-term
  debt, interest paid on short-term debt, and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the IMF.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on external debt are gathered through the World Bank's Debtor Reporting
  System (DRS). Long term debt data are compiled using the countries report on public and publicly guaranteed
  borrowing on a loan-by-loan basis and private non guaranteed borrowing on an aggregate basis. These
  data are supplemented by information from major multilateral banks and official lending agencies in
  major creditor countries. Short-term debt data are gathered from the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
  (QEDS) database, jointly developed by the World Bank and the IMF and from creditors through the reporting
  systems of the Bank for International Settlements. Debt data are reported in the currency of repayment
  and compiled and published in U.S. dollars. End-of-period exchange rates are used for the compilation
  of stock figures (amount of debt outstanding), and projected debt service and annual average exchange
  rates are used for the flows. Exchange rates are taken from the IMF's International Financial Statistics.
  Debt repayable in multiple currencies, goods, or services and debt with a provision for maintenance
  of the value of the currency of repayment are shown at book value.
