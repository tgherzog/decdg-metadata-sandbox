description: Total external debt stocks to gross national income. Total external debt is debt owed to
  nonresidents repayable in currency, goods, or services. Total external debt is the sum of public, publicly
  guaranteed, and private nonguaranteed long-term debt, use of IMF credit, and short-term debt. Short-term
  debt includes all debt having an original maturity of one year or less and interest in arrears on long-term
  debt. GNI (formerly GNP) is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes
  (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation
  of employees and property income) from abroad.

Developmentrelevance: 'External debt is that part of the total debt in a country that is owed to creditors
  outside the country. The debtors can be the government, corporations or private households. The debt
  includes money owed to private commercial banks, other governments, or international financial institutions.


  External indebtedness affects a country''s creditworthiness and investor perceptions. Nonreporting countries
  might have outstanding debt with the World Bank, other international financial institutions, or private
  creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries'' ability to obtain foreign exchange through
  exports of goods, services, primary income, and workers'' remittances.


  Debt ratios are used to assess the sustainability of a country''s debt service obligations, but no absolute
  rules determine what values are too high. Empirical analysis of developing countries'' experience and
  debt service performance shows that debt service difficulties become increasingly likely when the present
  value of debt reaches 200 percent of exports. Still, what constitutes a sustainable debt burden varies
  by country. Countries with fast-growing economies and exports are likely to be able to sustain higher
  debt levels. Various indicators determine a sustainable level of external debt, including:


  a) debt to GDP ratio

  b) foreign debt to exports ratio

  c) government debt to current fiscal revenue ratio 

  d) share of foreign debt

  e) short-term debt

  f) concessional debt in the total debt stock'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on external debt are gathered through the World Bank's Debtor Reporting
  System (DRS). Long term debt data are compiled using the countries report on public and publicly guaranteed
  borrowing on a loan-by-loan basis and private non guaranteed borrowing on an aggregate basis. These
  data are supplemented by information from major multilateral banks and official lending agencies in
  major creditor countries. Short-term debt data are gathered from the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
  (QEDS) database, jointly developed by the World Bank and the IMF and from creditors through the reporting
  systems of the Bank for International Settlements. Debt data are reported in the currency of repayment
  and compiled and published in U.S. dollars. End-of-period exchange rates are used for the compilation
  of stock figures (amount of debt outstanding), and projected debt service and annual average exchange
  rates are used for the flows. Exchange rates are taken from the IMF's International Financial Statistics.
  Debt repayable in multiple currencies, goods, or services and debt with a provision for maintenance
  of the value of the currency of repayment are shown at book value.
