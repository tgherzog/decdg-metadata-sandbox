description: Net official development assistance (ODA) consists of disbursements of loans made on concessional
  terms (net of repayments of principal) and grants by official agencies of the members of the Development
  Assistance Committee (DAC), by multilateral institutions, and by non-DAC countries to promote economic
  development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. It includes
  loans with a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent).
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'The ratio of aid to imports of goods and services provides a measure of recipient
  country''s dependency on aid. Ratios of aid are generally much higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in
  other regions, and they increased in the 1980s. High ratios are due only in part to aid flows. Many
  African countries saw severe erosion in their terms of trade in the 1980s, along with weak policies,
  falling incomes, imports, and investment. Thus the increase in aid dependency ratios reflects events
  affecting both the numerator (aid) and the denominator (imports of goods and services).


  DAC exists to help its members coordinate their development assistance and to encourage the expansion
  and improve the effectiveness of the aggregate resources flowing to recipient economies. In this capacity
  DAC monitors the flow of all financial resources, but its main concern is official development assistance
  (ODA). Grants or loans to countries and territories on the DAC list of aid recipients have to meet three
  criteria to be counted as ODA. They are provided by official agencies, including state and local governments,
  or by their executive agencies. They promote economic development and welfare as the main objective.
  And they are provided on concessional financial terms (loans must have a grant element of at least 25
  percent, calculated at a discount rate of 10 percent). The DAC Statistical Reporting Directives provide
  the most detailed explanation of this definition and all ODA-related rules.


  DAC statistics aim to meet the needs of policy makers in the field of development co-operation, and
  to provide a means of assessing the comparative performance of aid donors. DAC statistics are used extensively
  in the Peer Reviews conducted for each DAC member every four to five years, and have a wide range of
  other applications. They are used to measure donors'' compliance with various international recommendations
  in the field of development co-operation (terms, volume), and are indispensable for analysis of virtually
  every aspect of development and development co-operation.


  From 1960 to 1990, official development assistance (ODA) flows from DAC countries to developing countries
  rose steadily, but then fell sharply in the 1990s. Since then, a series of high-profile international
  conferences have boosted ODA flows. In the mid-2000s, ODA once again rose due to exceptional debt relief
  operations for Iraq and Nigeria. Despite the recent financial crisis, ODA flows have continued to rise
  and in the early 2010s reached their highest real level ever at about US $130 billion. This demonstrates
  effectiveness of aid pledges, especially when they are made on the basis of adequate resources and backed
  by strong political will.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Data on ODA is for aid-receiving countries. The data cover loans and grants
  from DAC member countries, multilateral organizations, and non-DAC donors. They do not reflect aid given
  by recipient countries to other developing countries. As a result, some countries that are net donors
  are shown as aid recipients. The indicator does not distinguish types of aid (program, project, or food
  aid; emergency assistance; or post-conflict peacekeeping assistance), which may have different effects
  on the economy.


  Ratio of aid to imports of goods and services provides measures of recipient country''s dependency on
  aid. But care must be taken in drawing policy conclusions. For foreign policy reasons some countries
  have traditionally received large amounts of aid. Thus aid dependency ratio may reveal as much about
  a donor''s interests as about a recipient''s needs. Data on imports are compiled from customs reports
  and balance of payments data. Although data from the payments side provide reasonably reliable records
  of cross-border transactions, they may not adhere strictly to the appropriate definitions of valuation
  and timing used in the balance of payments or correspond to the change of ownership criterion. This
  issue has assumed greater significance with the increasing globalization of international business.
  Neither customs nor balance of payments data usually capture the illegal transactions that occur in
  many countries. Goods carried by travelers across borders in league but unreported shuttle trade may
  further distort trade statistics.


  Because the indicator relies on information from donors, it is not necessarily consistent with information
  recorded by recipients in the balance of payments, which often excludes all or some technical assistance
  - particularly payments to expatriates made directly by the donor. Similarly, grant commodity aid may
  not always be recorded in trade data or in the balance of payments. Moreover, DAC statistics exclude
  aid for military and antiterrorism purposes.


  The aggregates refer to World Bank classifications of economies and therefore may differ from those
  of the OECD.'

Shortdefinition: Net official development assistance is disbursement flows (net of repayment of principal)
  that meet the DAC definition of ODA and are made to countries and territories on the DAC list of aid
  recipients.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Net official development assistance (ODA) per capita consists of disbursements
  of loans made on concessional terms (net of repayments of principal) and grants by official agencies
  of the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), by multilateral institutions, and by non-DAC
  countries to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of
  ODA recipients. It includes loans with a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate
  of discount of 10 percent).


  Data on imports are compiled from customs reports and balance of payments data. They include the value
  of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services.
  They exclude compensation of employees and investment income (factor services in the 1969 SNA) and transfer
  payments.


  The flows of official and private financial resources from the members of the Development Assistance
  Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to developing economies
  are compiled by DAC, based principally on reporting by DAC members using standard questionnaires issued
  by the DAC Secretariat.


  The ODA excludes nonconcessional flows from official creditors, which are classified as "other official
  flows," and aid for military and anti-terrorism purposes. Transfer payments to private individuals,
  such as pensions, reparations, and insurance payouts, are in general not counted. In addition to financial
  flows, ODA includes technical cooperation, most expenditures for peacekeeping under UN mandates and
  assistance to refugees, contributions to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and its
  specialized agencies, and concessional funding to multilateral development banks.


  Flows are transfers of resources, either in cash or in the form of commodities or services measured
  on a cash basis. Short-term capital transactions (with one year or less maturity) are not counted. Repayments
  of the principal (but not interest) of ODA loans are recorded as negative flows. Proceeds from official
  equity investments in a developing country are reported as ODA, while proceeds from their later sale
  are recorded as negative flows.


  The official development assistance estimates are published annually at the end of the calendar year
  in International Development Statistics (IDS) database. Net ODA received as a percent of imports of
  goods and services is calculated using values in U.S. dollars converted at official exchange rates.'
