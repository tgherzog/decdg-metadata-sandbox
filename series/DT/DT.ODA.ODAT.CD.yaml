description: Net official development assistance (ODA) consists of disbursements of loans made on concessional
  terms (net of repayments of principal) and grants by official agencies of the members of the Development
  Assistance Committee (DAC), by multilateral institutions, and by non-DAC countries to promote economic
  development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. It includes
  loans with a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent).
  Data are in current U.S. dollars.

Developmentrelevance: 'DAC exists to help its members coordinate their development assistance and to encourage
  the expansion and improve the effectiveness of the aggregate resources flowing to recipient economies.
  In this capacity DAC monitors the flow of all financial resources, but its main concern is official
  development assistance (ODA). Grants or loans to countries and territories on the DAC list of aid recipients
  have to meet three criteria to be counted as ODA. They are provided by official agencies, including
  state and local governments, or by their executive agencies. They promote economic development and welfare
  as the main objective. And they are provided on concessional financial terms (loans must have a grant
  element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a discount rate of 10 percent). The DAC Statistical Reporting
  Directives provide the most detailed explanation of this definition and all ODA-related rules.


  DAC statistics aim to meet the needs of policy makers in the field of development co-operation, and
  to provide a means of assessing the comparative performance of aid donors. DAC statistics are used extensively
  in the Peer Reviews conducted for each DAC member every four to five years, and have a wide range of
  other applications. They are used to measure donors'' compliance with various international recommendations
  in the field of development co-operation (terms, volume), and are indispensable for analysis of virtually
  every aspect of development and development co-operation.


  From 1960 to 1990, official development assistance (ODA) flows from DAC countries to developing countries
  rose steadily, but then fell sharply in the 1990s. Since then, a series of high-profile international
  conferences have boosted ODA flows. In the mid-2000s, ODA once again rose due to exceptional debt relief
  operations for Iraq and Nigeria. Despite the recent financial crisis, ODA flows have continued to rise
  and in the early 2010s reached their highest real level ever at about USD 130 billion. This demonstrates
  effectiveness of aid pledges, especially when they are made on the basis of adequate resources and backed
  by strong political will.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Data on ODA is for aid-receiving countries. The data cover loans and grants
  from DAC member countries, multilateral organizations, and non-DAC donors. They do not reflect aid given
  by recipient countries to other developing countries. As a result, some countries that are net donors
  are shown as aid recipients. The indicator does not distinguish types of aid (program, project, or food
  aid; emergency assistance; or post-conflict peacekeeping assistance), which may have different effects
  on the economy.


  Because the indicator relies on information from donors, it is not necessarily consistent with information
  recorded by recipients in the balance of payments, which often excludes all or some technical assistance
  - particularly payments to expatriates made directly by the donor. Similarly, grant commodity aid may
  not always be recorded in trade data or in the balance of payments. Moreover, DAC statistics exclude
  aid for military and antiterrorism purposes.


  The nominal values may overstate the real value of aid to recipients. Changes in international prices
  and exchange rates can reduce the purchasing power of aid. Tying aid, still prevalent though declining
  in importance, also tends to reduce its purchasing power. Tying requires recipients to purchase goods
  and services from the donor country or from a specified group of countries. Such arrangements prevent
  a recipient from misappropriating or mismanaging aid receipts, but they may also be motivated by a desire
  to benefit donor country suppliers.


  The aggregates refer to World Bank classifications of economies and therefore may differ from those
  of the OECD.'
Periodicity: Annual
Shortdefinition: Net official development assistance is disbursement flows (net of repayment of principal)
  that meet the DAC definition of ODA and are made to countries and territories on the DAC list of aid
  recipients. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The flows of official and private financial resources from the members
  of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
  (OECD) to developing economies are compiled by DAC, based principally on donor reports on bilateral
  programs by DAC members using standard questionnaires issued by the DAC Secretariat. DAC has 24 members
  - 23 individual economies and 1 multilateral institution (European Union institutions). 


  Net official development assistance (ODA) consists of disbursements of loans made on concessional terms
  (net of repayments of principal) and grants by official agencies of the members of DAC, by multilateral
  institutions, and by non-DAC countries to promote economic development and welfare in countries and
  territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. It includes loans with a grant element of at least 25
  percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent). Data are in current U.S. dollars.


  Total net disbursements is the sum of grants, capital subscriptions (deposit basis), recoveries and
  total net loans and other long-term capital.


  The ODA excludes nonconcessional flows from official creditors, which are classified as "other official
  flows," and aid for military and anti-terrorism purposes. Transfer payments to private individuals,
  such as pensions, reparations, and insurance payouts, are in general not counted. In addition to financial
  flows, ODA includes technical cooperation, most expenditures for peacekeeping under UN mandates and
  assistance to refugees, contributions to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and its
  specialized agencies, and concessional funding to multilateral development banks.



  Flows are transfers of resources, either in cash or in the form of commodities or services measured
  on a cash basis. Short-term capital transactions (with one year or less maturity) are not counted. Repayments
  of the principal (but not interest) of ODA loans are recorded as negative flows. Proceeds from official
  equity investments in a developing country are reported as ODA, while proceeds from their later sale
  are recorded as negative flows.


  The official development assistance (ODA) estimates are published annually at the end of the calendar
  year in International Development Statistics (IDS) database.'
