Developmentrelevance: 'External indebtedness affects a country''s creditworthiness and investor perceptions.
  Nonreporting countries might have outstanding debt with the World Bank, other international financial
  institutions, or private creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries'' ability to obtain
  foreign exchange through exports of goods, services, primary income, and workers'' remittances.


  Debt ratios are used to assess the sustainability of a country''s debt service obligations, but no absolute
  rules determine what values are too high. Empirical analysis of developing countries'' experience and
  debt service performance shows that debt service difficulties become increasingly likely when the present
  value of debt reaches 200 percent of exports. Still, what constitutes a sustainable debt burden varies
  by country. Countries with fast-growing economies and exports are likely to be able to sustain higher
  debt levels.'

Shortdefinition: Total external debt is debt owed to nonresidents repayable in currency, goods, or services.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on external debt are gathered through the World Bank's Debtor Reporting
  System (DRS). Long term debt data are compiled using the countries report on public and publicly guaranteed
  borrowing on a loan-by-loan basis and private non guaranteed borrowing on an aggregate basis. These
  data are supplemented by information from major multilateral banks and official lending agencies in
  major creditor countries. Short-term debt data are gathered from the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
  (QEDS) database, jointly developed by the World Bank and the IMF and from creditors through the reporting
  systems of the Bank for International Settlements. Debt data are reported in the currency of repayment
  and compiled and published in U.S. dollars. End-of-period exchange rates are used for the compilation
  of stock figures (amount of debt outstanding), and projected debt service and annual average exchange
  rates are used for the flows. Exchange rates are taken from the IMF's International Financial Statistics.
  Debt repayable in multiple currencies, goods, or services and debt with a provision for maintenance
  of the value of the currency of repayment are shown at book value.
