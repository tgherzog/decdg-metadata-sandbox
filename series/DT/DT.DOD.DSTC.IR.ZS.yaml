description: Short-term debt includes all debt having an original maturity of one year or less and interest
  in arrears on long-term debt. Total reserves includes gold.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'External debt is that part of the total debt in a country that is owed to creditors
  outside the country. The debtors can be the government, corporations or private households. The debt
  includes money owed to private commercial banks, other governments, or international financial institutions.


  External indebtedness affects a country''s creditworthiness and investor perceptions. Nonreporting countries
  might have outstanding debt with the World Bank, other international financial institutions, or private
  creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries'' ability to obtain foreign exchange through
  exports of goods, services, primary income, and workers'' remittances.


  Debt ratios are used to assess the sustainability of a country''s debt service obligations, but no absolute
  rules determine what values are too high. Empirical analysis of developing countries'' experience and
  debt service performance shows that debt service difficulties become increasingly likely when the present
  value of debt reaches 200 percent of exports. Still, what constitutes a sustainable debt burden varies
  by country. Countries with fast-growing economies and exports are likely to be able to sustain higher
  debt levels. Various indicators determine a sustainable level of external debt, including:


  a) debt to GDP ratio

  b) foreign debt to exports ratio

  c) government debt to current fiscal revenue ratio 

  d) share of foreign debt

  e) short-term debt

  f) concessional debt in the total debt stock'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The DRS encourages debtor countries to voluntarily provide information on their
  short-term external obligations. By its nature, short-term external debt is difficult to monitor: loan-by-loan
  registration is normally impractical, and monitoring systems typically rely on information requested
  periodically by the central bank from the banking sector. The World Bank regards the debtor country
  as the authoritative source of information on its short-term debt. Where such information is not available
  from the debtor country, data are derived from BIS data on international bank lending based on time
  remaining to original maturity. The data are reported based on residual maturity, but an estimate of
  short-term external liabilities by original maturity can be derived by deducting from claims due in
  one year those that have a maturity of between one and two years. However, BIS data include liabilities
  reported only by banks within the BIS reporting area. The results should thus be interpreted with caution.
  Because short-term debt poses an immediate burden and is particularly important for monitoring vulnerability,
  it is compared with total debt and foreign exchange reserves, which are instrumental in providing coverage
  for such obligations.


  A country''s external debt burden, both debt outstanding and debt service, affects its creditworthiness
  and vulnerability. While data related to public and publicly guaranteed debt are reported to the DRS
  on a loan-by-loan basis, aggregate data on long-term private nonguaranteed debt are reported annually
  and are reported by the country or estimated by World Bank staff for countries where this type of external
  debt is known to be significant. Estimates are based on national data from the World Bank''s Quarterly
  External Debt Statistics.'
Periodicity: Annual

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on external debt are gathered through the World Bank's Debtor Reporting
  System (DRS). Long term debt data are compiled using the countries report on public and publicly guaranteed
  borrowing on a loan-by-loan basis and private non guaranteed borrowing on an aggregate basis. These
  data are supplemented by information from major multilateral banks and official lending agencies in
  major creditor countries. Short-term debt data are gathered from the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
  (QEDS) database, jointly developed by the World Bank and the IMF and from creditors through the reporting
  systems of the Bank for International Settlements. Debt data are reported in the currency of repayment
  and compiled and published in U.S. dollars. End-of-period exchange rates are used for the compilation
  of stock figures (amount of debt outstanding), and projected debt service and annual average exchange
  rates are used for the flows. Exchange rates are taken from the IMF's International Financial Statistics.
  Debt repayable in multiple currencies, goods, or services and debt with a provision for maintenance
  of the value of the currency of repayment are shown at book value.
