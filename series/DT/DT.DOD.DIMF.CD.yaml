Developmentrelevance: 'External indebtedness affects a country''s creditworthiness and investor perceptions.
  Nonreporting countries might have outstanding debt with the World Bank, other international financial
  institutions, or private creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries'' ability to obtain
  foreign exchange through exports of goods, services, primary income, and workers'' remittances.


  Debt ratios are used to assess the sustainability of a country''s debt service obligations, but no absolute
  rules determine what values are too high. Empirical analysis of developing countries'' experience and
  debt service performance shows that debt service difficulties become increasingly likely when the present
  value of debt reaches 200 percent of exports. Still, what constitutes a sustainable debt burden varies
  by country. Countries with fast-growing economies and exports are likely to be able to sustain higher
  debt levels.'

Shortdefinition: "Use of IMF credit denotes members\u2019 drawings on the IMF other than amounts drawn\
  \ against the country\u2019s reserve tranche position. Use of IMF credit includes purchases and drawings\

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Data related to the operations of the IMF come from the IMF Treasurer''s
  Department and are converted from special drawing rights (SDRs) into dollars using end-of-period exchange
  rates for stocks and average over the period exchange rates for converting flows. DOD refers to disbursed
  and outstanding debt; data are in current U.S. dollars.


  Data on external debt are gathered through the World Bank''s Debtor Reporting System (DRS). Long term
  debt data are compiled using the countries report on public and publicly guaranteed borrowing on a loan-by-loan
  basis and private non guaranteed borrowing on an aggregate basis. These data are supplemented by information
  from major multilateral banks and official lending agencies in major creditor countries. Short-term
  debt data are gathered from the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, jointly developed
  by the World Bank and the IMF and from creditors through the reporting systems of the Bank for International
  Settlements. Debt data are reported in the currency of repayment and compiled and published in U.S.
  dollars. End-of-period exchange rates are used for the compilation of stock figures (amount of debt
  outstanding), and projected debt service and annual average exchange rates are used for the flows. Exchange
  rates are taken from the IMF''s International Financial Statistics. Debt repayable in multiple currencies,
  goods, or services and debt with a provision for maintenance of the value of the currency of repayment
  are shown at book value.'

description: "Use of IMF Credit: Data related to the operations of the IMF are provided by the IMF Treasurer\u2019\
  s Department. They are converted from special drawing rights into dollars using end-of-period exchange\
  \ rates for stocks and average-over-the-period exchange rates for flows. IMF trust fund operations under\
  \ the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, Extended Fund Facility, Poverty Reduction and Growth\
  \ Facility, and Structural Adjustment Facility (Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility in 1999) are\
  \ presented together with all of the IMF\u2019s special facilities (buffer stock, supplemental reserve,\
  \ compensatory and contingency facilities, oil facilities, and other facilities). SDR allocations are\
  \ also included in this category. According to the BPM6, SDR allocations are recorded as the incurrence\
  \ of a debt liability of the member receiving them (because of a requirement to repay the allocation\
  \ in certain circumstances, and also because interest accrues). This debt item is introduced for the\
  \ first time this year with historical data starting in 1999."
