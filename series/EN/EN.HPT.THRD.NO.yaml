description: Higher plants are native vascular plant species. Threatened species are the number of species
  classified by the IUCN as endangered, vulnerable, rare, indeterminate, out of danger, or insufficiently
  known.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'The number of threatened species is an important measure of the immediate need
  for conservation in an area. Global analyses of the status of threatened species have been carried out
  for few groups of organisms. Only for mammals, birds, and amphibians has the status of virtually all
  known species been assessed.


  Threatened species are defined using the International Union for Conservation of Nature''s (IUCN) classification:
  endangered (in danger of extinction and unlikely to survive if causal factors continue operating) and
  vulnerable (likely to move into the endangered category in the near future if causal factors continue
  operating).


  The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is widely recognized
  as the most comprehensive, objective global approach for evaluating the conservation status of plant
  and animal species. The IUCN guides conservation activities of governments, NGOs and scientific institutions.
  The IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost
  every country in the world, who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge
  base on the biology and conservation status of species.


  The plants and animals assessed for the IUCN Red List are the bearers of genetic diversity and the building
  blocks of ecosystems, and information on their conservation status and distribution provides the foundation
  for making informed decisions about conserving biodiversity from local to global levels. Only a small
  number of the world''s plant and animal species have been assessed. In addition to the many thousands
  of species which have not yet been assessed so far, other species not included on the IUCN Red List
  are those that went extinct before 1500 AD and the "Least Concern" (plants that have been evaluated
  to have a low risk of extinction) species that have not yet been data based.


  Direct threats to species are the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting,
  or may impact the status of the taxon being assessed (e.g., unsustainable fishing or logging). Direct
  threats are synonymous with sources of stress and proximate pressures. Threats can be past (historical,
  unlikely to return or historical, likely to return), ongoing, and/or likely to occur in the future.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Reporting the proportion of threatened species on the Red List is complicated
  by the fact that not all species groups have been fully evaluated, and also by the fact that some species
  have so little information available that they can only be assessed as Data Deficient (DD). For many
  of the incompletely evaluated groups, assessment efforts have focused on species that are likely to
  be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily
  biased (i.e., the percentage of threatened species would likely be an overestimate).


  Although there are over 12,000 plant species on the IUCN Red List, fewer than one thousand of these
  are properly documented. To help address this gap, IUCN is pursuing global assessments of plant species
  of value to people including species of high economic value. The conifer and cycad species already on
  the IUCN Red List need to be fully documented. IUCN is also developing a tool to assist with preliminary
  assessments of plant species.


  Since IUCN has evaluated extinction risk for less than 5 percent of the world''s described species,
  IUCN cannot provide an overall estimate for how many of the planet''s species are threatened. For those
  groups that have been comprehensively evaluated, the proportion of threatened species can be calculated,
  but the number of threatened species is often uncertain because it is not known whether Data Deficient
  species are actually threatened or not.


  Due to variations in consistency and methods of collection, data quality is highly variable across countries.
  Some countries update their information more frequently than others, some have more accurate data on
  extent of coverage, and many underreport the number or extent of protected areas. Also, because of differences
  in definitions, reporting practices, and reporting periods, cross-country comparability of threatened
  species is limited.


  In order to ensure global uniformity when describing the habitat in which a taxon (a taxonomic group
  of any rank) occurs, the threats to a taxon, what conservation actions are in place or are needed, and
  whether or not the taxon is utilized, a set of standard terms, called Classification Schemes, are being
  developed, for documenting taxonomy on the IUCN Red List.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Species assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) or
  Vulnerable (VU) are referred to as "threatened" species. The International Union for Conservation of
  Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species collects and disseminates information on the global threated
  species.


  Proportion of threatened species is only reported for the more completely evaluated groups (i.e., >90%
  of species evaluated). Also, the reported percentage of threatened species for each group is presented
  as a best estimate within a range of possible values bounded by lower and upper estimates:


  Lower estimate = % threatened extant species if all Data Deficient species are not threatened, i.e.,
  (CR + EN + VU) / (total assessed - EX)


  Best estimate = % threatened extant species if Data Deficient species are equally threatened as data
  sufficient species, i.e., (CR + EN + VU) / (total assessed - EX - DD)


  Upper estimate = % threatened extant species if all Data Deficient species are threatened, i.e., (CR
  + EN + VU + DD) / (total assessed - EX)


  Additional information on ecology and habitat preferences, threats, and conservation action are also
  collated and assessed as part of Red List process.'
