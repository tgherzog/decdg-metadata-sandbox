description: Population density is midyear population divided by land area in square kilometers. Population
  is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status
  or citizenship--except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally
  considered part of the population of their country of origin. Land area is a country's total area, excluding
  area under inland water bodies, national claims to continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones.
  In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Population estimates are usually based on national population censuses. Estimates
  for the years before and after the census are interpolations or extrapolations based on demographic
  models. Errors and undercounting occur even in high-income countries; in developing countries errors
  may be substantial because of limits in the transport, communications, and other resources required
  conducting and analyzing a full census.


  Population density is a measure of the intensity of land-use, and can be calculated for a block, city,
  county, state, country, continent or the entire world. Considering that over half of the Earth''s land
  mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that
  population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, a simple number of population density
  by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.


  Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are city-states, microstates, or dependencies.[6][7]
  These territories share a relatively small area and a high urbanization level, with an economically
  specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference
  between high population density and overpopulation.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Current population estimates for developing countries that lack recent census
  data and pre- and post-census estimates for countries with census data are provided by the United Nations
  Population Division and other agencies. The cohort component method - a standard method for estimating
  and projecting population - requires fertility, mortality, and net migration data, often collected from
  sample surveys, which can be small or limited in coverage. Population estimates are from demographic
  modeling and so are susceptible to biases and errors from shortcomings in the model and in the data.
  Because the five-year age group is the cohort unit and five-year period data are used, interpolations
  to obtain annual data or single age structure may not reflect actual events or age composition.


  The quality and reliability of official demographic data are also affected by public trust in the government,
  government commitment to full and accurate enumeration, confidentiality and protection against misuse
  of census data, and census agencies'' independence from political influence. Moreover, comparability
  of population indicators is limited by differences in the concepts, definitions, collection procedures,
  and estimation methods used by national statistical agencies and other organizations that collect the
  data.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Population density is midyear population divided by land area in square
  kilometers. This ratio can be calculated for any territorial unit for any point in time, depending on
  the source of the population data. Populationestimates are prepared by World Bank staff from variety
  of sources. They are based on the de facto definition of population and include all residents regardless
  of legal status or citizenship, within the physical boundaries of a country and under the jurisdiction
  of that country''s political control. Refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum are
  considered part of the population of their country of origin. Population numbers are either current
  census data or historical census data extrapolated through demographic methods. The count also excludes
  visitors from overseas.
