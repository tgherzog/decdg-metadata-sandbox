Developmentrelevance: Scientists use the terms climate change and global warming to refer to the gradual
  increase in the Earth's surface temperature that has accelerated since the industrial revolution and
  especially over the past two decades. Most global warming has been caused by human activities that have
  changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere through a buildup of greenhouse gases - primarily
  carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Rising global temperatures will cause sea level rise and
  alter local climate conditions, affecting forests, crop yields, and water supplies, and may affect human
  health, animals, and many types of ecosystems.

Limitationsandexceptions: "The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) assessment report\
  \ concluded that global warming is \u201Cunequivocal\u201D and gave the strongest warning yet about\
  \ the role of human activities. The report estimated that sea levels would rise approximately 49 centimeters\
  \ over the next 100 years, with a range of uncertainty of 20\u201386 centimeters. That will lead to\
  \ increased coastal flooding through direct inundation and a higher base for storm surges, allowing\
  \ flooding of larger areas and higher elevations. Climate model simulations predict an increase in average\
  \ surface air temperature of about 2.5\xB0C by 2100 (Kattenberg and others 1996) and increase of \u201C\
  killer\u201D heat waves during the warm season (Karl and others 1997)."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Population counts in low elevation zones in the year 1990 as described
  by GRUMPv1 input estimates allocated into 3 arc second grid cells. Population counts in low elevation
  zones in the year 2000 as described by GRUMPv1 input estimates allocated into 3 arc second grid cells.
  Population counts in low elevation zones in the year 2010 derived from the application of United Nations
  2000-2010 national growth rates to year 2000 population data from GRUMPv1 (see documentation for full
  description of methodologies).
