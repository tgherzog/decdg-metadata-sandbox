Developmentrelevance: 'The addition of man-made greenhouse gases to the Atmosphere disturbs the earth''s
  radiative balance. This is leading to an increase in the earth''s surface temperature and to related
  effects on climate, sea level rise and world agriculture. Emissions of CO2 are from burning oil, coal
  and gas for energy use, burning wood and waste materials, and from industrial processes such as cement
  production. Emission intensity is the average emission rate of a given pollutant from a given source
  relative to the intensity of a specific activity. Emission intensities are also used to compare the
  environmental impact of different fuels or activities. The related terms - emission factor and carbon
  intensity - are often used interchangeably.


  The carbon dioxide emissions of a country are only an indicator of one greenhouse gas. For a more complete
  idea of how a country influences climate change, gases such as methane and nitrous oxide should be taken
  into account. This is particularly important in agricultural economies.


  The environmental effects of carbon dioxide are of significant interest. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes
  up the largest share of the greenhouse gases contributing to global warming and climate change. Converting
  all other greenhouse gases (methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons
  (PFCs), Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) to carbon dioxide (or CO2) equivalents makes it possible to compare
  them and to determine their individual and total contributions to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol,
  an environmental agreement adopted in 1997 by many of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is working towards curbing CO2 emissions globally.'

Limitationsandexceptions: National reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
  that follows the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines is based on national emission
  inventories and covers all sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions as well as carbon sinks
  (such as forests). To estimate emissions, the countries that are Parties to the Climate Change Convention
  (UNFCCC) use complex, state-of-the-art methodologies recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
  Change (IPCC).

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Methane emissions are those stemming from human activities such as agriculture
  and from industrial methane production. Expressed in CO2 equivalent using the GWP100 metric of the Second
  Assessment Report of IPCC and include CH4 (GWP100=21). The emissions are usually expressed in carbon
  dioxide equivalents using the global warming potential, which allows the effective contributions of
  different gases to be compared. A kilogram of methane is 21 times as effective at trapping heat in the
  earth's atmosphere as a kilogram of carbon dioxide within 100 years.
