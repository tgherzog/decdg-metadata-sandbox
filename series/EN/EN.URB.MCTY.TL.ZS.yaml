Developmentrelevance: "According to the United Nations, an Urban Agglomeration refers to the de facto\
  \ population contained within the contours of a contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels\
  \ without regard to administrative boundaries. It usually incorporates the population in a city or town\
  \ plus that in the sub-urban areas lying outside of but being adjacent to the city boundaries. In general,\
  \ an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central\
  \ place and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses\
  \ the term unit\xE9 urbaine, which means continuous urbanized area. There are differences in definitions\
  \ of what does and does not constitute an \"agglomeration\", as well as differenced in statistical and\
  \ geographical methodology. Some of the well-known urban agglomerations of the world are Tokyo, New\
  \ York City, Mexico City, New Delhi, and Seoul.\n\nA metropolitan area includes the urban area, and\
  \ its satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban\
  \ core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary\
  \ labor market. According to the United Nations' definition, a metropolitan area includes both the contiguous\
  \ territory inhabited at urban levels of residential density and additional surrounding areas of lower\
  \ settlement density that are also under the direct influence of the city (e.g., through frequent transport,\
  \ road linkages, commuting facilities etc.).\n\nExplosive growth of cities globally signifies the demographic\
  \ transition from rural to urban, and is associated with shifts from an agriculture-based economy to\
  \ mass industry, technology, and service. For the first time ever, the majority of the world's population\
  \ lives in a city, and this proportion continues to grow. One hundred years ago, 2 out of every 10 people\
  \ lived in an urban area. By 1990, less than 40 percent of the global population lived in a city, but\
  \ as of early 2010s, more than half of all people live in an urban area. By 2030, 6 out of every 10\
  \ people will live in a city, and by 2050, this proportion will increase to 7 out of 10 people. About\
  \ half of all urban dwellers live in cities with between 100,000-500,000 people, and fewer than 10%\
  \ of urban dwellers live in megacities (a city with a population of more than 10 million, as defined\
  \ by UN HABITAT). Currently, the number of urban residents is growing by nearly 60 million every year.\n\
  \nBy the middle of the 21st century, the urban population will almost double, reaching 6.4 billion in\
  \ 2050. Almost all urban population growth in the next 30 years will occur in cities of developing countries.\
  \ By the middle of the 21st century, it is estimated that the urban population of developing counties\
  \ will more than double, reaching almost 5.2 billion in 2050. In high-income countries, the urban population\
  \ is expected to remain largely unchanged over the next two decades, reaching to just over 1 billion\
  \ by 2025. In these countries, immigration (legal and illegal) will account for more than two-thirds\
  \ of urban growth. Without immigration, the urban population in these countries would most likely decline\
  \ or remain static.\n\nIn principle, cities offer a more favorable setting for the resolution of social\
  \ and environmental problems than rural areas. Cities generate jobs and income, and deliver education,\
  \ health care and other services. Cities also present opportunities for social mobilization and women's\
  \ empowerment. Poverty is growing faster in urban than in rural areas. According to UN one billion people\
  \ live in urban slums, which are typically overcrowded, polluted and dangerous, and lack basic services\
  \ such as clean water and sanitation."

Limitationsandexceptions: "Due to varying definitions, it is not possible to compare different agglomerations\
  \ around the world.\n\nAggregation of urban and rural population may not add up to total population\
  \ because of different country coverage. There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for\
  \ distinguishing urban from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries.\n\
  \n Most countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of settlements.\
  \ Some define urban areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. And other countries\
  \ designate urban areas based on administrative arrangements. Because of national differences in the\
  \ characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between urban and rural population\
  \ is not amenable to a single definition that would be applicable to all countries. For example, in\
  \ Botswana, agglomeration of 5,000 or more inhabitants where 75 per cent of the economic activity is\
  \ non-agricultural is considered \"urban\" while in Iceland localities of 200 or more inhabitants, and\
  \ in Peru population centers with 100 or more dwellings, are considered \"urban.\" In the United States\
  \ places of 2,500 or more inhabitants, generally having population densities of 1,000 persons per square\
  \ mile or more are considered \"urban\".\n\nEstimates of the world's urban population would change significantly\
  \ if China, India, and a few other populous nations were to change their definition of urban centers.\
  \ According to China's State Statistical Bureau, by the end of 1996 urban residents accounted for about\
  \ 43 percent of China's population, more than double the 20 percent considered urban in 1994. In addition\
  \ to the continuous migration of people from rural to urban areas, one of the main reasons for this\
  \ shift was the rapid growth in the hundreds of towns reclassified as cities in recent years.\n\nBecause\
  \ the estimates of city and metropolitan area are based on national definitions of what constitutes\
  \ a city or metropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. To estimate urban\
  \ populations, UN ratios of urban to total population were applied to the World Bank's estimates of\
  \ total population."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined
  by national statistical offices. The indicator is calculated using World Bank population estimates and
  urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects. The United Nations Population Division
  and other agencies provide current population estimates for developing countries that lack recent census
  data and pre- and post-census estimates for countries with census data. The cohort component method
  - a standard method for estimating and projecting population - requires fertility, mortality, and net
  migration data, often collected from sample surveys, which can be small or limited in coverage. Population
  estimates are from demographic modeling and so are susceptible to biases and errors from shortcomings
  in the model and in the data. Because the five-year age group is the cohort unit and five-year period
  data are used, interpolations to obtain annual data or single age structure may not reflect actual events
  or age composition.


  Countries differ in the way they classify population as "urban" or "rural." Typically, a community or
  settlement with a population of 2,000 or more is considered urban, but national definitions are most
  commonly based on size of locality. Eurostat defines urban areas as clusters of contiguous grid cells
  of 1 km2 with a density of at least 300 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 5,000. Further
  it defines high-density cluster as contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants
  per km2 and a minimum population of 50,000.


  The population of a city or metropolitan area depends on the boundaries chosen. For example, in 1990
  Beijing, China, contained 2.3 million people in 87 square kilometers of "inner city" and 5.4 million
  in 158 square kilometers of "core city." The population of "inner city and inner suburban districts"
  was 6.3 million and that of "inner city, inner and outer suburban districts, and inner and outer counties"
  was 10.8 million. (Most countries use the last definition.)'
