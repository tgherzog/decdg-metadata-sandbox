Developmentrelevance: "As threats to biodiversity mount, the international community is increasingly focusing\
  \ on conserving diversity. The Red List Index for the world's birds shows that there has been a steady\
  \ and continuing deterioration in the threat status of the world's birds since 1988, when the first\
  \ complete global assessment was carried out.\n\nThe number of threatened species is an important measure\
  \ of the immediate need for conservation in an area. Global analyses of the status of threatened species\
  \ have been carried out for few groups of organisms. Only for mammals, birds, and amphibians has the\
  \ status of virtually all known species been assessed.\n\n Threatened species are defined using the\
  \ International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) classification: endangered (in danger of extinction\
  \ and unlikely to survive if causal factors continue operating) and vulnerable (likely to move into\
  \ the endangered category in the near future if causal factors continue operating).\n\nThe International\
  \ Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is widely recognized as the\
  \ most comprehensive, objective global approach for evaluating the conservation status of plant and\
  \ animal species. The IUCN guides conservation activities of governments, NGOs and scientific institutions.\
  \ The IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost\
  \ every country in the world, who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge\
  \ base on the biology and conservation status of species.\n\nGlobally, threatened birds occur worldwide\
  \ - nearly all countries support one or more threatened bird species. Small islands hold disproportionately\
  \ high numbers of Globally Threatened Birds, supporting over half of threatened species. Threatened\
  \ seabirds are found throughout the world's oceans. The most important threats to the world's birds\
  \ are the spread of agriculture and an ever increasing human use of biological resources.\n\nDirect\
  \ threats to species are the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting,\
  \ or may impact the status of the taxon being assessed (e.g., unsustainable fishing or logging). Direct\
  \ threats are synonymous with sources of stress and proximate pressures. Threats can be past (historical,\
  \ unlikely to return or historical, likely to return), ongoing, and/or likely to occur in the future."

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Reporting the proportion of threatened species on the Red List is complicated
  by the fact that not all species groups have been fully evaluated, and also by the fact that some species
  have so little information available that they can only be assessed as Data Deficient (DD). For many
  of the incompletely evaluated groups, assessment efforts have focused on species that are likely to
  be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily
  biased (i.e., the percentage of threatened species would likely be an overestimate).


  Since IUCN has evaluated extinction risk for less than 5 percent of the world''s described species,
  IUCN cannot provide an overall estimate for how many of the planet''s species are threatened. For those
  groups that have been comprehensively evaluated, the proportion of threatened species can be calculated,
  but the number of threatened species is often uncertain because it is not known whether Data Deficient
  species are actually threatened or not.


  Due to variations in consistency and methods of collection, data quality is highly variable across countries.
  Some countries update their information more frequently than others, some have more accurate data on
  extent of coverage, and many underreport the number or extent of protected areas. Also, because of differences
  in definitions, reporting practices, and reporting periods, cross-country comparability of threatened
  species is limited.


  In order to ensure global uniformity when describing the habitat in which a taxon (a taxonomic group
  of any rank) occurs, the threats to a taxon, what conservation actions are in place or are needed, and
  whether or not the taxon is utilized, a set of standard terms, called Classification Schemes, are being
  developed, for documenting taxonomy on the IUCN Red List.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Species assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) or
  Vulnerable (VU) are referred to as "threatened" species. The International Union for Conservation of
  Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species collects and disseminates information on the global threated
  species.


  Proportion of threatened species is only reported for the more completely evaluated groups (i.e., >90%
  of species evaluated). Also, the reported percentage of threatened species for each group is presented
  as a best estimate within a range of possible values bounded by lower and upper estimates:


  Lower estimate = % threatened extant species if all Data Deficient species are not threatened, i.e.,
  (CR + EN + VU) / (total assessed - EX)


  Best estimate = % threatened extant species if Data Deficient species are equally threatened as data
  sufficient species, i.e., (CR + EN + VU) / (total assessed - EX - DD)


  Upper estimate = % threatened extant species if all Data Deficient species are threatened, i.e., (CR
  + EN + VU + DD) / (total assessed - EX)


  Additional information on ecology and habitat preferences, threats, and conservation action are also
  collated and assessed as part of Red List process.'

  species are the number of species classified by the IUCN as endangered, vulnerable, rare, indeterminate,
