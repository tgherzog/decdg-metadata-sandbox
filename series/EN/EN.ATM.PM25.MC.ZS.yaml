Developmentrelevance: "Air pollution places a major burden on world health. In many places, including\
  \ cities but also in rural areas, exposure to air pollution is the main environmental threat to health,\
  \ responsible for 6.5 million deaths per year, about one every 5 seconds. Around 40 percent of the world\u2019\
  s people rely on household burning of wood, charcoal, dung, crop waste, or coal to meet basic energy\
  \ needs. Cooking and heating with solid fuels create harmful smoke and particles that fill homes and\
  \ the surrounding environment. Household air pollution from cooking and heating with solid fuels is\
  \ responsible for 2.9 million deaths a year. Long-term exposure to high levels of fine particles in\
  \ the air contributes to a range of health effects, including respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and\
  \ heart disease, resulting in 4.2 million deaths annually. Not only does exposure to air pollution affect\
  \ the health of the world\u2019s people, it also carries huge economic costs and represents a drag on\
  \ development, particularly for low and middle income countries and vulnerable segments of the population\
  \ such as children and the elderly."

Limitationsandexceptions: Pollutant concentrations are sensitive to local conditions, and even monitoring
  sites in the same city may register different levels. Direct monitoring of PM2.5 is still rare in most
  parts of the world, and measurement protocols and standards are not the same for all countries. These
  data should be considered only a general indication of air quality, intended to inform cross-country
  comparisons of the health risks due to particulate matter pollution. The guideline set by the World
  Health Organization (WHO) for PM2.5 is that annual mean concentrations should not exceed 10 micrograms
  per cubic meter, representing the lower range over which adverse health effects have been observed.
  The WHO has also recommended guideline values for emissions of PM2.5 from burning fuels in households.
