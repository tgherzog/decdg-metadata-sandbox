description: Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture
  of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and
  gas flaring.
Aggregationmethod: Gap-filled total
Developmentrelevance: 'Carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally occurring gas fixed by photosynthesis into organic
  matter. A byproduct of fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning, it is also emitted from land use
  changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects
  the Earth''s radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured,
  thus having a Global Warming Potential of 1.


  Burning of carbon-based fuels since the industrial revolution has rapidly increased concentrations of
  atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing the rate of global warming and causing anthropogenic climate
  change. It is also a major source of ocean acidification since it dissolves in water to form carbonic
  acid.


  The addition of man-made greenhouse gases to the Atmosphere disturbs the earth''s radiative balance.
  This is leading to an increase in the earth''s surface temperature and to related effects on climate,
  sea level rise and world agriculture. Emissions of CO2 are from burning oil, coal and gas for energy
  use, burning wood and waste materials, and from industrial processes such as cement production.


  Emission intensity is the average emission rate of a given pollutant from a given source relative to
  the intensity of a specific activity. Emission intensities are also used to compare the environmental
  impact of different fuels or activities. The related terms - emission factor and carbon intensity -
  are often used interchangeably.


  The carbon dioxide emissions of a country are only an indicator of one greenhouse gas. For a more complete
  idea of how a country influences climate change, gases such as methane and nitrous oxide should be taken
  into account. This is particularly important in agricultural economies.


  The environmental effects of carbon dioxide are of significant interest. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes
  up the largest share of the greenhouse gases contributing to global warming and climate change. Converting
  all other greenhouse gases (methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons
  (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) to carbon dioxide (or CO2) equivalents makes it possible to compare
  them and to determine their individual and total contributions to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol,
  an environmental agreement adopted in 1997 by many of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is working towards curbing CO2 emissions globally.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The U.S. Department of Energy''s Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
  (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United
  Nations Statistics Division''s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S.
  Department of Interior''s Geological Survey, USGS 2011). Although estimates of global carbon dioxide
  emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average fuel chemistry
  and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends estimated from a consistent time series
  tend to be more accurate than individual values.


  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and
  corrections. Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because
  of the difficulty of apportioning the fuels among benefiting countries.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Carbon dioxide emissions, largely by-products of energy production
  and use, account for the largest share of greenhouse gases, which are associated with global warming.
  Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing.
  In combustion different fossil fuels release different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same level
  of energy use: oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases
  about twice as much. Cement manufacturing releases about half a metric ton of carbon dioxide for each
  metric ton of cement produced. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil
  fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation. The unit of
  measurement is kt (kiloton). Carbon dioxide emissions are often calculated and reported as elemental
  carbon. The were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.667 (the ratio of
  the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).'
