Developmentrelevance: 'Investment in infrastructure projects with private participation has made important
  contributions to improving the efficiency of infrastructure services, and extending delivery to poor
  people. Developing countries have been in the forefront, looking for better approaches to infrastructure
  services and reaping the benefits of greater competition and customer focus. Entrepreneurship is essential
  to the dynamism of the modern market economy, and a greater entry density of new businesses can foster
  competition and economic growth.


  Private sector development and investment - tapping private sector initiative and investment for socially
  useful purposes - are critical for poverty reduction. In parallel with public sector efforts, private
  investment, especially in competitive markets, has tremendous potential to contribute to growth. Private
  markets are the engine of productivity growth, creating productive jobs and higher incomes. And with
  government playing a complementary role of regulation, funding, and service provision, private initiative
  and investment can help provide the basic services and conditions that empower poor people - by improving
  health, education, and infrastructure.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The data on investment in infrastructure projects with private participation
  refer to all investment commitments (public and private) in projects in which a private company assumes
  operating risk during the operating period or development and operating risk during the contract period.
  Investment refers to commitments not disbursements. Foreign state-owned companies are considered private
  entities for the purposes of this measure.


  Movable assets and small projects are excluded. The types of projects included are operations and management
  contracts, operations and management contracts with major capital expenditure, greenfield projects (in
  which a private entity or a public-private joint venture builds and operates a new facility), and divestitures.
  Investment commitments are the sum of investments in facilities and investments in government assets.
  Investments in facilities are the resources the project company commits to invest during the contract
  period either in new facilities or in expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Investments
  in government assets are the resources the project company spends on acquiring government assets such
  as state-owned enterprises, rights to provide services in a specific area, or the use of specific radio
  spectrums. Data on the projects are compiled from publicly available information. The database aims
  to be as comprehensive as possible, but some projects - particularly those involving local and small-scale
  operators - may be omitted because they are not publicly reported. Data are available 2015 onwards only
  for ICT.'
