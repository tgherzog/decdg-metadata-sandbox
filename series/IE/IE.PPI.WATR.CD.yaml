description: Investment in water and sanitation projects with private participation refers to commitments
  to  infrastructure projects in water and sanitation that have reached financial closure and directly
  or indirectly serve the public. Movable assets, incinerators, standalone solid waste projects, and small
  projects are excluded. The types of projects included are management and lease contracts, operations
  and management contracts with major capital expenditure, greenfield projects (in which a private entity
  or a public-private joint venture builds and operates a new facility), and divestitures. Investment
  commitments are the sum of investments in facilities and investments in government assets. Investments
  in facilities are the resources the project company commits to invest during the contract period either
  in new facilities or in expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Investments in government
  assets are the resources the project company spends on acquiring government assets such as state-owned
  enterprises, rights to provide services in a specific area, or the use of specific radio spectrums.
  Data is presented based on investment year. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

Developmentrelevance: 'Investment in infrastructure projects with private participation has made important
  contributions to easing fiscal constraints, improving the efficiency of infrastructure services, and
  extending delivery to poor people. Developing countries have been in the forefront, pioneering better
  approaches to infrastructure services and reaping the benefits of greater competition and customer focus.
  Entrepreneurship is essential to the dynamism of the modern market economy, and a greater entry density
  of new businesses can foster competition and economic growth.


  Private sector development and investment - tapping private sector initiative and investment for socially
  useful purposes - are critical for poverty reduction. In parallel with public sector efforts, private
  investment, especially in competitive markets, has tremendous potential to contribute to growth. Private
  markets are the engine of productivity growth, creating productive jobs and higher incomes. And with
  government playing a complementary role of regulation, funding, and service provision, private initiative
  and investment can help provide the basic services and conditions that empower poor people - by improving
  health, education, and infrastructure.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The data on investment in infrastructure projects with private participation
  refer to all investment (public and private) in projects in which a private company assumes operating
  risk during the operating period or development and operating risk during the contract period. Investment
  refers to commitments not disbursements. Foreign state-owned companies are considered private entities
  for the purposes of this measure.


  Investment commitments are the sum of investments in physical assets and payments to the government.
  Investments in physical assets are resources the project company commits to invest during the contract
  period in new facilities or in expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Payments to the government
  are the resources the project company spends on acquiring government assets such as state-owned enterprises,
  rights to provide services in a specific area, or use of specific radio spectrums. Data on the projects
  are compiled from publicly available information. The database aims to be as comprehensive as possible,
  but some projects - particularly those involving local and small-scale operators - may be omitted because
  they are not publicly reported.'
Periodicity: Annual

  (PPI) Project database, which tracks infrastructure projects with private participation in developing
  countries. It provides information on more than 5,000 infrastructure projects in 139 developing economies
  from 1984. The database contains more than 30 fields per project record, including country, financial
  closure year, infrastructure services provided, type of private participation, investment, technology,
  capacity, project location, contract duration, private sponsors, bidding process, and development bank
  support.


  The database is a joint product of the World Bank''s Finance, Economics, and Urban Development Department
