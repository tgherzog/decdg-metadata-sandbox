description: Technical cooperation grants include free-standing technical cooperation grants, which are
  intended to finance the transfer of technical and managerial skills or of technology for the purpose
  of building up general national capacity without reference to any specific investment projects; and
  investment-related technical cooperation grants, which are provided to strengthen the capacity to execute
  specific investment projects. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'DAC exists to help its members coordinate their development assistance and to encourage
  the expansion and improve the effectiveness of the aggregate resources flowing to recipient economies.
  In this capacity DAC monitors the flow of all financial resources, but its main concern is official
  development assistance (ODA). Grants or loans to countries and territories on the DAC list of aid recipients
  have to meet three criteria to be counted as ODA. They are provided by official agencies, including
  state and local governments, or by their executive agencies. They promote economic development and welfare
  as the main objective. And they are provided on concessional financial terms (loans must have a grant
  element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a discount rate of 10 percent). The DAC Statistical Reporting
  Directives provide the most detailed explanation of this definition and all ODA-related rules.


  OECD''s IDS database provides a set of readily available basic data that enables analysis on where aid
  goes, what purposes it serves and what policies it aims to implement, on a comparable basis for all
  DAC members. The aid data is most commonly used to analyze the sectoral and geographical breakdown of
  aid for selected years and donors or groups of donors. The data can also be used to target specific
  policy issues (e.g. tying status of aid) and monitor donors'' compliance with various international
  recommendations in the field of development co-operation.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Data on ODA is for aid-receiving countries. The data cover loans and grants
  from DAC member countries, multilateral organizations, and non-DAC donors. They do not reflect aid given
  by recipient countries to other developing countries. As a result, some countries that are net donors
  (such as Saudi Arabia) are shown as aid recipients. The indicator does not distinguish types of aid
  (program, project, or food aid; emergency assistance; or post-conflict peacekeeping assistance), which
  may have different effects on the economy.


  Because this indicator relies on information from donors, it is not necessarily consistent with information
  recorded by recipients in the balance of payments, which often excludes all or some technical assistance
  - particularly payments to expatriates made directly by the donor. Similarly, grant commodity aid may
  not always be recorded in trade data or in the balance of payments. Moreover, DAC statistics exclude
  aid for military and antiterrorism purposes.


  The aggregates refer to World Bank classifications of economies and therefore may differ from those
  of the OECD.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Technical cooperation contributions take the form mainly of the supply
  of human resources from donors or action directed to human resources (such as training or advice). Also
  included are aid for promoting development awareness and aid provided to refugees in the donor economy.
  Assistance specifically to facilitate a capital project is not included. Technical cooperation ncludes
  both grants to nationals of aid recipient countries receiving education or training at home or abroad
  and payments to consultants, advisers and similar personnel as well as teachers and administrators serving
  in recipient countries (including the cost of associated equipment).


  The flows of official and private financial resources from the members of the Development Assistance
  Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to developing economies
  are compiled by DAC, based principally on reporting by DAC members using standard questionnaires issued
  by the DAC Secretariat. A network of statistical correspondents collects data from aid agencies and
  government departments (central, state and local) on an ongoing basis. Their task is also to ensure
  that reporting conforms to the Reporting Directives (definitions and classifications) agreed by the
  DAC.


  The official development assistance (ODA) estimates are published annually at the end of the calendar
  year in International Development Statistics (IDS) database. Data are in current U.S. dollars.'
