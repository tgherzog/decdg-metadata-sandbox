Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'DAC exists to help its members coordinate their development assistance and to encourage
  the expansion and improve the effectiveness of the aggregate resources flowing to recipient economies.
  In this capacity DAC monitors the flow of all financial resources, but its main concern is official
  development assistance (ODA). Grants or loans to countries and territories on the DAC list of aid recipients
  have to meet three criteria to be counted as ODA. They are provided by official agencies, including
  state and local governments, or by their executive agencies. They promote economic development and welfare
  as the main objective. And they are provided on concessional financial terms (loans must have a grant
  element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a discount rate of 10 percent). The DAC Statistical Reporting
  Directives provide the most detailed explanation of this definition and all ODA-related rules.


  OECD''s IDS database provides a set of readily available basic data that enables analysis on where aid
  goes, what purposes it serves and what policies it aims to implement, on a comparable basis for all
  DAC members. The aid data is most commonly used to analyze the sectoral and geographical breakdown of
  aid for selected years and donors or groups of donors. The data can also be used to target specific
  policy issues (e.g. tying status of aid) and monitor donors'' compliance with various international
  recommendations in the field of development co-operation.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Data on ODA is for aid-receiving countries. The data cover loans and grants
  from DAC member countries, multilateral organizations, and non-DAC donors. They do not reflect aid given
  by recipient countries to other developing countries. As a result, some countries that are net donors
  (such as Saudi Arabia) are shown as aid recipients. The indicator does not distinguish types of aid
  (program, project, or food aid; emergency assistance; or post-conflict peacekeeping assistance), which
  may have different effects on the economy.


  Because the indicator relies on information from donors, it is not necessarily consistent with information
  recorded by recipients in the balance of payments, which often excludes all or some technical assistance
  - particularly payments to expatriates made directly by the donor. Similarly, grant commodity aid may
  not always be recorded in trade data or in the balance of payments. Moreover, DAC statistics exclude
  aid for military and antiterrorism purposes.


  The aggregates refer to World Bank classifications of economies and therefore may differ from those
  of the OECD.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Grants are transfers made in cash, goods or services for which no repayment
  is required. Data excludes technical cooperation grants. The flows of official and private financial
  resources from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic
  Co-operation and Development (OECD) to developing economies are compiled by DAC, based principally on
  reporting by DAC members using standard questionnaires issued by the DAC Secretariat. A network of statistical
  correspondents collects data from aid agencies and government departments (central, state and local)
  on an ongoing basis. Their task is also to ensure that reporting conforms to the Reporting Directives
  (definitions and classifications) agreed by the DAC.


  The official development assistance (ODA) estimates are published annually at the end of the calendar
  year in International Development Statistics (IDS) database. Data are in current U.S. dollars.'
