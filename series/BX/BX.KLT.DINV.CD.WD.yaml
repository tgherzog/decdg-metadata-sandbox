description: Foreign direct investment refers to direct investment equity flows in the reporting economy.
  It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and other capital. Direct investment is a
  category of cross-border investment associated with a resident in one economy having control or a significant
  degree of influence on the management of an enterprise that is resident in another economy. Ownership
  of 10 percent or more of the ordinary shares of voting stock is the criterion for determining the existence
  of a direct investment relationship. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: Private financial flows - equity and debt - account for the bulk of development
  finance. Equity flows comprise foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity. Debt flows are
  financing raised through bond issuance, bank lending, and supplier credits.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'FDI data do not give a complete picture of international investment in an economy.
  Balance of payments data on FDI do not include capital raised locally, an important source of investment
  financing in some developing countries. In addition, FDI data omit nonequity cross-border transactions
  such as intra-unit flows of goods and services.


  The volume of global private financial flows reported by the World Bank generally differs from that
  reported by other sources because of differences in sources, classification of economies, and method
  used to adjust and disaggregate reported information. In addition, particularly for debt financing,
  differences may also reflect how some installments of the transactions and certain offshore issuances
  are treated.


  Data on equity flows are shown for all countries for which data are available.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Data on equity flows are based on balance of payments data reported
  by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Foreign direct investment (FDI) data are supplemented by the
  World Bank staff estimates using data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
  and official national sources.


  The internationally accepted definition of FDI (from the sixth edition of the IMF''s Balance of Payments
  Manual [2009]), includes the following components: equity investment, including investment associated
  with equity that gives rise to control or influence; investment in indirectly influenced or controlled
  enterprises; investment in fellow enterprises; debt (except selected debt); and reverse investment.
  The Framework for Direct Investment Relationships provides criteria for determining whether cross-border
  ownership results in a direct investment relationship, based on control and influence. Distinguished
  from other kinds of international investment, FDI is made to establish a lasting interest in or effective
  management control over an enterprise in another country. A lasting interest in an investment enterprise
  typically involves establishing warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and other permanent or long-term
  organizations abroad. Direct investments may take the form of greenfield investment, where the investor
  starts a new venture in a foreign country by constructing new operational facilities; joint venture,
  where the investor enters into a partnership agreement with a company abroad to establish a new enterprise;
  or merger and acquisition, where the investor acquires an existing enterprise abroad. The IMF suggests
  that investments should account for at least 10 percent of voting stock to be counted as FDI. In practice
  many countries set a higher threshold. Many countries fail to report reinvested earnings, and the definition
  of long-term loans differs among countries. BoP refers to Balance of Payments.'
