Developmentrelevance: 'Stock market size can be measured in various ways, and each may produce a different
  ranking of countries.


  The development of an economy''s financial markets is closely related to its overall development. Well-functioning
  financial systems provide good and easily accessible information which can lower transaction costs and
  subsequently improve resource allocation and boosts economic growth. Both banking systems and stock
  markets enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction. At low levels of economic development
  commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while at higher levels domestic stock markets
  tend to become more active and efficient relative to domestic banks.


  Open economies with sound macroeconomic policies, good legal systems, and shareholder protection attract
  capital and therefore have larger financial markets. Recent research on stock market development shows
  that modern communications technology and increased financial integration have resulted in more cross-border
  capital flows, a stronger presence of financial firms around the world, and the migration of stock exchange
  activities to international exchanges. Many firms in emerging markets now cross-list on international
  exchanges, which provides them with lower cost capital and more liquidity-traded shares. However, this
  also means that exchanges in emerging markets may not have enough financial activity to sustain them,
  putting pressure on them to rethink their operations.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Data cover measures of size (market capitalization, number of listed domestic
  companies) and liquidity (value of shares traded as a percentage of gross domestic product, value of
  shares traded as a percentage of market capitalization). The comparability of such data across countries
  may be limited by conceptual and statistical weaknesses, such as inaccurate reporting and differences
  in accounting standards.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Market capitalization figures include: shares of listed domestic companies;
  shares of foreign companies which are exclusively listed on an exchange (i.e., the foreign company is
  not listed on any other exchange); common and preferred shares of domestic companies; and shares without
  voting rights. Market capitalization figures exclude: collective investment funds ; rights, warrants,
  ETFs, convertible instruments ; options, futures ; foreign listed shares other than exclusively listed
  ones; companies whose only business goal is to hold shares of other listed companies, such as holding
  companies and investment companies, regardless of their legal status; and companies admitted to trading
  (i.e., companies whose shares are traded at the exchange but not listed at the exchange).'
Topic: 'Financial Sector: Capital markets'
description: Market capitalization (also known as market value) is the share price times the number of
  shares outstanding (including their several classes) for listed domestic companies. Investment funds,
  unit trusts, and companies whose only business goal is to hold shares of other listed companies are
  excluded. Data are end of year values converted to U.S. dollars using corresponding year-end foreign
  exchange rates.
