Developmentrelevance: 'Stock market size can be measured in various ways, and each may produce a different
  ranking of countries.


  The development of an economy''s financial markets is closely related to its overall development. Well-functioning
  financial systems provide good and easily accessible information which can lower transaction costs and
  subsequently improve resource allocation and boosts economic growth. Both banking systems and stock
  markets enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction. At low levels of economic development
  commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while at higher levels domestic stock markets
  tend to become more active and efficient relative to domestic banks.


  Open economies with sound macroeconomic policies, good legal systems, and shareholder protection attract
  capital and therefore have larger financial markets. Recent research on stock market development shows
  that modern communications technology and increased financial integration have resulted in more cross-border
  capital flows, a stronger presence of financial firms around the world, and the migration of stock exchange
  activities to international exchanges. Many firms in emerging markets now cross-list on international
  exchanges, which provides them with lower cost capital and more liquidity-traded shares. However, this
  also means that exchanges in emerging markets may not have enough financial activity to sustain them,
  putting pressure on them to rethink their operations.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Data cover measures of size (market capitalization, number of listed domestic
  companies) and liquidity (value of shares traded as a percentage of gross domestic product, value of
  shares traded as a percentage of market capitalization). The comparability of such data across countries
  may be limited by conceptual and statistical weaknesses, such as inaccurate reporting and differences
  in accounting standards. Only domestic shares are used in order to be consistent with domestic market
  capitalization.

  shares traded divided by their market capitalization. The value is annualized by multiplying the monthly
  average by 12, according to the following formula: (Monthly EOB domestic shares traded / Month-end domestic
  market capitalization) x 12.'
