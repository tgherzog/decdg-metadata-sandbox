description: The value of shares traded is the total number of shares traded, both domestic and foreign,
  multiplied by their respective matching prices. Figures are single counted (only one side of the transaction
  is considered). Companies admitted to listing and admitted to trading are included in the data. Data
  are end of year values.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Stock market size can be measured in various ways, and each may produce a different
  ranking of countries.


  The development of an economy''s financial markets is closely related to its overall development. Well-functioning
  financial systems provide good and easily accessible information which can lower transaction costs and
  subsequently improve resource allocation and boosts economic growth. Both banking systems and stock
  markets enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction. At low levels of economic development
  commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while at higher levels domestic stock markets
  tend to become more active and efficient relative to domestic banks.


  Open economies with sound macroeconomic policies, good legal systems, and shareholder protection attract
  capital and therefore have larger financial markets. Recent research on stock market development shows
  that modern communications technology and increased financial integration have resulted in more cross-border
  capital flows, a stronger presence of financial firms around the world, and the migration of stock exchange
  activities to international exchanges. Many firms in emerging markets now cross-list on international
  exchanges, which provides them with lower cost capital and more liquidity-traded shares. However, this
  also means that exchanges in emerging markets may not have enough financial activity to sustain them,
  putting pressure on them to rethink their operations.'
Generalcomments: Stock market data were previously sourced from Standard & Poor's until they discontinued
  their "Global Stock Markets Factbook" and database in April 2013. Time series have been replaced in
  December 2015 with data from the World Federation of Exchanges and may differ from the previous S&P
  definitions and methodology.

Limitationsandexceptions: Data cover measures of size (market capitalization, number of listed domestic
  companies) and liquidity (value of shares traded as a percentage of gross domestic product, value of
  shares traded as a percentage of market capitalization). The comparability of such data across countries
  may be limited by conceptual and statistical weaknesses, such as inaccurate reporting and differences
  in accounting standards. Only EOB trades are included in the total value of shares traded.
Periodicity: Annual
Source: World Federation of Exchanges database.
Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The value of shares traded represent the transfer of ownership effected
  automatically through the exchange's electronic order book (EOB), where orders placed by trading members
  are usually exposed to all market users and automatically matched according to precise rules set up
  by the exchange, generally on a price/time priority basis. For data before 2001, the WFE used two different
  approaches for the collection of trading data, depending on the individual stock exchange's market organization
  and rules. The first approach is the Trading System View (TSV). Stock exchanges adopting this view count
  only those transactions which pass through their trading system or trading floor. The TSV is generally
  adopted by exchanges which operate a centralized order book (order-driven market). Trades done by their
  members off the exchange are not included. The second approach is the Regulated Environment View (REV).
  Stock exchanges in this category include all transactions subject to supervision by the market authority,
  including transactions made by members, and sometimes non-members, on outside trading systems and transactions
  into foreign markets. Figures reported under the REV approach will be higher than those reported under
  the TSV approach.
