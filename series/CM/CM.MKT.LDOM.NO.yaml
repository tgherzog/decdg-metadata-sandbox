description: Listed domestic companies, including foreign companies which are exclusively listed, are
  those which have shares listed on an exchange at the end of the year. Investment funds, unit trusts,
  and companies whose only business goal is to hold shares of other listed companies, such as holding
  companies and investment companies, regardless of their legal status, are excluded. A company with several
  classes of shares is counted once. Only companies admitted to listing on the exchange are included.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'Stock market size can be measured in various ways, and each may produce a different
  ranking of countries.


  The development of an economy''s financial markets is closely related to its overall development. Well-functioning
  financial systems provide good and easily accessible information which can lower transaction costs and
  subsequently improve resource allocation and boosts economic growth. Both banking systems and stock
  markets enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction. At low levels of economic development
  commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while at higher levels domestic stock markets
  tend to become more active and efficient relative to domestic banks.


  Open economies with sound macroeconomic policies, good legal systems, and shareholder protection attract
  capital and therefore have larger financial markets. Recent research on stock market development shows
  that modern communications technology and increased financial integration have resulted in more cross-border
  capital flows, a stronger presence of financial firms around the world, and the migration of stock exchange
  activities to international exchanges. Many firms in emerging markets now cross-list on international
  exchanges, which provides them with lower cost capital and more liquidity-traded shares. However, this
  also means that exchanges in emerging markets may not have enough financial activity to sustain them,
  putting pressure on them to rethink their operations.'

  their "Global Stock Markets Factbook" and database in April 2013. Time series have been replaced in
  December 2015 with data from the World Federation of Exchanges and may differ from the previous S&P
  definitions and methodology.

Limitationsandexceptions: Data cover measures of size (market capitalization, number of listed domestic
  companies) and liquidity (value of shares traded as a percentage of gross domestic product, value of
  shares traded as a percentage of market capitalization). The comparability of such data across countries
  may be limited by conceptual and statistical weaknesses, such as inaccurate reporting and differences
  in accounting standards.
Periodicity: Annual

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: A company is considered domestic when it is incorporated in the same
  country as where the exchange is located. The only exception is the case of foreign companies which
  are exclusively listed on an exchange (i.e., the foreign company is not listed on any other exchange
  as defined in the domestic market capitalization definition).
