Developmentrelevance: 'The cultivation of cereals varies widely in different countries and depends partly
  upon the development of the economy. Production depends on the nature of the soil, the amount of rainfall,
  irrigation, quality od seeds, and the techniques applied to promote growth.


  In developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a combine harvester,
  which cuts, threshes, and winnows the grain during a single pass across the field. In many industrialized
  countries, particularly in the United States and Canada, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested
  grain to a grain elevator or a storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. In developing
  countries, a variety of harvesting methods are used in cereal cultivation, depending on the cost of
  labor, from small combines to hand tools such as the scythe or cradle.


  Crop production systems have evolved rapidly over the past century and have resulted in significantly
  increased crop yields, but have also created undesirable environmental side-effects such as soil degradation
  and erosion, pollution from chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals and a loss of bio-diversity. Factors
  such as the green revolution, has led to impressive progress in increasing cereals yields over the last
  few decades. This progress, however, is not equal across all regions. Continued progress depends on
  maintaining agricultural research and education. The cultivation of cereals varies widely in different
  countries and depends partly upon the development of the economy. Production depends on the nature of
  the soil, the amount of rainfall, irrigation, quality of seeds, and the techniques applied to promote
  growth.


  Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing
  countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources. Poor
  farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Efforts to increase productivity
  by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation have environmental costs and health
  impacts. Salinization of irrigated land diminishes soil fertility. Thus, inappropriate use of inputs
  for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.


  There is no single correct mix of inputs to the agricultural land, as it is dependent on local climate,
  land quality, and economic development; appropriate levels and application rates vary by country and
  over time and depend on the type of crops, the climate and soils, and the production process used.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The data are collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
  Nations (FAO) through annual questionnaires. They are supplemented with information from official secondary
  data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites of national ministries,
  national publications and related country data reported by various international organizations. The
  FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting methods, but complete consistency across countries
  and over time is not possible. Thus, data on agricultural land in different climates may not be comparable.
  For example, permanent pastures are quite different in nature and intensity in African countries and
  dry Middle Eastern countries.


  Data on agricultural land are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural
  production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Cereals production includes wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye,
  millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for
  dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those
  used for grazing are excluded.


  A cereal is a grass cultivated for the edible components of their grain, composed of the endosperm,
  germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide
  than any other type of crop; cereal crops therefore can also be called staple crops.'

  sown or cultivated area. Cereals include wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat,

  harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded.
