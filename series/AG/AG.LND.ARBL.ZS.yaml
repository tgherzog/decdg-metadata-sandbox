Developmentrelevance: 'Agricultural land covers more than one-third of the world''s land area. Agricultural
  land constitutes only a part of any country''s total area, which can include areas not suitable for
  agriculture, such as forests, mountains, and inland water bodies.


  Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing
  countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources. Poor
  farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Efforts to increase productivity
  by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation have environmental costs and health
  impacts. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers can alter the chemistry of soil. Pesticide poisoning
  is common in developing countries. And salinization of irrigated land diminishes soil fertility. Thus,
  inappropriate use of inputs for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.


  There is significant geographic variation in the availability of land considered suitable for agriculture.
  Increasing population and demand from other sectors place growing pressure on available resources. According
  to FAO, the world''s cultivated area has grown by 12 percent over the last 50 years. The global irrigated
  area has doubled over the same period, accounting for most of the net increase in cultivated land. Agriculture
  already uses 11 percent of the world''s land surface for crop production. It also makes use of 70 percent
  of all water withdrawn from aquifers, streams and lakes. Agricultural policies have primarily benefitted
  farmers with productive land and access to water, bypassing the majority of small-scale producers who
  are still locked in a poverty trap of high vulnerability, land degradation and climatic uncertainty.


  Land resources are central to agriculture and rural development, and are intrinsically linked to global
  challenges of food insecurity and poverty, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as degradation
  and depletion of natural resources that affect the livelihoods of millions of rural people across the
  world.


  In many industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations. In the context
  of zoning, agricultural land (or more properly agriculturally zoned land) refers to plots that may be
  used for agricultural activities, regardless of the physical type or quality of land.


  FAO''s agricultural land data contains a wide range of information on variables that are significant
  for: understanding the structure of a country''s agricultural sector; making economic plans and policies
  for food security; deriving environmental indicators, including those related to investment in agriculture
  and data on gross crop area and net crop area which are useful for policy formulation and monitoring.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) tries to impose standard definitions
  and reporting methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible. Thus,
  data on agricultural land in different climates may not be comparable. For example, permanent pastures
  are quite different in nature and intensity in African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries.


  The data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations from official
  national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information from official secondary
  data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites of national ministries,
  national publications and related country data reported by various international organizations. Data
  on agricultural land are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural
  production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Agricultural land indicator,
  along with land-use indicators, can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries'' agricultural
  practices.


  True comparability of the data is limited, by variations in definitions, statistical methods, and quality
  of data. Countries use different definitions land use. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the
  United Nations (FAO), the primary compiler of the data, occasionally adjusts its definitions of land
  use categories and revises earlier data. Because the data reflect changes in reporting procedures as
  well as actual changes in land use, apparent trends should be interpreted cautiously.


  Satellite images show land use that differs from that of ground-based measures in area under cultivation
  and type of land use. Moreover, land use data in some countries (India is an example) are based on reporting
  systems designed for collecting tax revenue. With land taxes no longer a major source of government
  revenue, the quality and coverage of land use data have declined.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Temporary fallow land refers to land left fallow for less than five
  years. The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data
  for "Arable land" are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable. Total
  land area does not include inland water bodies such as major rivers and lakes. Variations from year
  to year may be due to updated or revised data rather than to change in area. The data collected by the
  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations from official national sources through
  the questionnaire are supplemented with information from official secondary data sources. The secondary
  sources cover official country data from websites of national ministries, national publications and
  related country data reported by various international organizations.
Topic: 'Environment: Land use'
description: Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped
  areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens,
  and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.
