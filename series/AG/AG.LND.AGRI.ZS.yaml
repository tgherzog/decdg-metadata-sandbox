Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Agricultural land covers more than one-third of the world''s land area, with arable
  land representing less than one-third of agricultural land (about 10 percent of the world''s land area).
  Agricultural land constitutes only a part of any country''s total area, which can include areas not
  suitable for agriculture, such as forests, mountains, and inland water bodies.


  In many industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations. In the context
  of zoning, agricultural land (or more properly agriculturally zoned land) refers to plots that may be
  used for agricultural activities, regardless of the physical type or quality of land.


  FAO''s agricultural land data contains a wide range of information on variables that are significant
  for: understanding the structure of a country''s agricultural sector; making economic plans and policies
  for food security; deriving environmental indicators, including those related to investment in agriculture
  and data on gross crop area and net crop area which are useful for policy formulation and monitoring.


  There is no single correct mix of inputs to the agricultural land, as it is dependent on local climate,
  land quality, and economic development; appropriate levels and application rates vary by country and
  over time and depend on the type of crops, the climate and soils, and the production process used.'

Limitationsandexceptions: The data are collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
  Nations (FAO) from official national sources through annual questionnaires and are supplemented with
  information from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data
  from websites of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various
  international organizations.. The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting methods, but
  complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible. Thus, data on agricultural land
  in different climates may not be comparable. For example, permanent pastures are quite different in
  nature and intensity in African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries. Data on agricultural employment,
  in particular, should be used with caution. In many countries much agricultural employment is informal
  and unrecorded, including substantial work performed by women and children. To address some of these
  concerns, this indicator is heavily footnoted in the database in sources, definition, and coverage.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural
  activities provide developing countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can
  degrade natural resources. Poor farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility.
  Efforts to increase productivity by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation
  have environmental costs and health impacts. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers can alter the chemistry
  of soil. Pesticide poisoning is common in developing countries. And salinization of irrigated land diminishes
  soil fertility. Thus, inappropriate use of inputs for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.


  Agricultural land is also sometimes classified as irrigated and non-irrigated land. In arid and semi-arid
  countries agriculture is often confined to irrigated land, with very little farming possible in non-irrigated
  areas. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded from Arable land.


  Data on agricultural land are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural
  production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Agricultural land indicator,
  along with land-use indicators, can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries'' agricultural
  practices.


  Total land area does not include inland water bodies such as major rivers and lakes. Variations from
  year to year may be due to updated or revised data rather than to change in area.'
Topic: 'Environment: Land use'
description: Agricultural land refers to the share of land area that is arable, under permanent crops,
  and under permanent pastures. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops
  (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market
  or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation
  is excluded. Land under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long
  periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category
  includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees
  grown for wood or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage, including
  natural and cultivated crops.
