description: Land area is a country's total area, excluding area under inland water bodies, national claims
  to continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones. In most cases the definition of inland water bodies
  includes major rivers and lakes.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'Land area is particularly important for understanding an economy''s agricultural
  capacity and the environmental effects of human activity. Innovations in satellite mapping and computer
  databases have resulted in more precise measurements of land and water areas.


  Population, land area, income, and output are basic measures of the size of an economy. They also provide
  a broad indication of actual and potential resources. Land area is therefore used as one of the major
  indicator to normalize other indicators.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The data are collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the
  United Nations through annual questionnaires. The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting
  methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible.


  The data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information
  from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites
  of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international
  organizations.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Total land area does not include inland water bodies such as major rivers
  and lakes. Variations from year to year may be due to updated or revised data rather than to change
  in area.
