description: Land area below 5m is the percentage of total land where the elevation is 5 meters or less.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Scientists use the terms climate change and global warming to refer to the gradual
  increase in the Earth's surface temperature that has accelerated since the industrial revolution and
  especially over the past two decades. Most global warming has been caused by human activities that have
  changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere through a buildup of greenhouse gases - primarily
  carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Rising global temperatures will cause sea level rise and
  alter local climate conditions, affecting forests, crop yields, and water supplies, and may affect human
  health, animals, and many types of ecosystems.

Limitationsandexceptions: "The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) assessment report
   concluded that global warming is \u201Cunequivocal\u201D and gave the strongest warning yet about the
   role of human activities. The report estimated that sea levels would rise approximately 49 centimeters
   over the next 100 years, with a range of uncertainty of 20\u201386 centimeters. That will lead to increased
   coastal flooding through direct inundation and a higher base for storm surges, allowing flooding of
   larger areas and higher elevations. Climate model simulations predict an increase in average surface
   air temperature of about 2.5\xB0C by 2100 (Kattenberg and others 1996) and increase of \u201Ckiller\u201D\
   heat waves during the warm season (Karl and others 1997)."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Elevation data used to generate the low elevation coastal zones come
   from the SRTM3 Enhanced Global Map developed by ISCIENCES. The ISCIENCES digital elevation model was
   created using NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data processed
   to 3 arc-seconds (SRTM3)."
