description: Agricultural machinery refers to the number of wheel and crawler tractors (excluding garden
  tractors) in use in agriculture at the end of the calendar year specified or during the first quarter
  of the following year. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped
  areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens,
  and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Agricultural land covers more than one-third of the world''s land area. In many
  industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations. In the context of zoning,
  agricultural land (or more properly agriculturally zoned land) refers to plots that may be used for
  agricultural activities, regardless of the physical type or quality of land.


  A substantial contribution to agriculture in the last century has been the escalation from manual and
  stock-animal farm work to gas-powered farm equipment. Globally, steel plows, mowers, mechanical reapers,
  seed drills, and threshers contributed to the development of mechanized agriculture, tractors enabled
  the farmer to sow and harvest large agricultural lands with less manpower. In modern times, powered
  machinery such as tractors, has replaced many jobs formerly carried out by men or animals such as oxen,
  horses and mules. FAO estimates that most farmers in developing countries experience a greater annual
  expenditure on farm power inputs than on fertilizer, seeds or agrochemicals.


  Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing
  countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources as poor
  farming practices cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility.


  There is no single correct mix of inputs to the agricultural land, as it is dependent on local climate,
  land quality, and economic development; appropriate levels and application rates vary by country and
  over time and depend on the type of crops, the climate and soils, and the production process used.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The data are collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
  Nations (FAO) through annual questionnaires. The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting
  methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible. Thus, data on agricultural
  land in different climates may not be comparable. For example, permanent pastures are quite different
  in nature and intensity in African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries. Data on agricultural
  employment, in particular, should be used with caution. In many countries much agricultural employment
  is informal and unrecorded, including substantial work performed by women and children. To address some
  of these concerns, this indicator is heavily footnoted in the database in sources, definition, and coverage.


  The data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information
  from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites
  of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international
  organizations.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'A tractor provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural
  tasks, especially tillage. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and
  the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. The most common use of
  the term "tractor" is for the vehicles used on farms. The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing
  agricultural machinery or trailers, for plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar
  tasks. Planting, tending and harvesting a crop requires both a significant amount of power and a suitable
  range of tools and equipment. Mechanization of farming has allowed an increase to the area that can
  be planted and has contributed towards increased yields, mainly due to the precision with which the
  farming tasks can be accomplished.


  Agricultural land constitutes only a part of any country''s total area, which can include areas not
  suitable for agriculture, such as forests, mountains, and inland water bodies. Data on agricultural
  land are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural production,
  food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Agricultural land indicator, along
  with land-use indicators, can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries'' agricultural
  practices.'
