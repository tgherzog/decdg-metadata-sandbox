Developmentrelevance: 'Total surface area is particularly important for understanding an economy''s agricultural
  capacity and the environmental effects of human activity. Innovations in satellite mapping and computer
  databases have resulted in more precise measurements of land and water areas.


  Population, surface area, income, and output are basic measures of the size of an economy. They also
  provide a broad indication of actual and potential resources. Land area is therefore used as one of
  the major indicator to normalize other indicators.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The data are collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the
  United Nations through annual questionnaires. The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting
  methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible.


  The data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information
  from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites
  of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international
  organizations.'
