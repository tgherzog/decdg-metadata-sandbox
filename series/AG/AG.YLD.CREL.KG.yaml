description: Cereal yield, measured as kilograms per hectare of harvested land, includes wheat, rice,
  maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data on cereals relate
  to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed,
  or silage and those used for grazing are excluded. The FAO allocates production data to the calendar
  year in which the bulk of the harvest took place. Most of a crop harvested near the end of a year will
  be used in the following year.

Developmentrelevance: 'In developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically
  using a combine harvester, which cuts, threshes, and winnows the grain during a single pass across the
  field. In many industrialized countries, particularly in the United States and Canada, farmers commonly
  deliver their newly harvested grain to a grain elevator or a storage facility that consolidates the
  crops of many farmers. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are used in cereal cultivation,
  depending on the cost of labor, from small combines to hand tools such as the scythe or cradle.


  Crop production systems have evolved rapidly over the past century and have resulted in significantly
  increased crop yields, but have also created undesirable environmental side-effects such as soil degradation
  and erosion, pollution from chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals and a loss of bio-diversity. Factors
  such as the green revolution, has led to impressive progress in increasing cereals yields over the last
  few decades. This progress, however, is not equal across all regions. Continued progress depends on
  maintaining agricultural research and education. The cultivation of cereals varies widely in different
  countries and depends partly upon the development of the economy. Production depends on the nature of
  the soil, the amount of rainfall, irrigation, quality of seeds, and the techniques applied to promote
  growth.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Cereals production data relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal
  crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are
  excluded. The FAO allocates production data to the calendar year in which the bulk of the harvest took
  place. Most of a crop harvested near the end of a year will be used in the following year.


  The data are collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) through
  annual questionnaires. The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting methods, but complete
  consistency across countries and over time is not possible. Thus, data on agricultural land in different
  climates may not be comparable. For example, permanent pastures are quite different in nature and intensity
  in African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries.


  Data on cereal yield may be affected by a variety of reporting and timing differences. Millet and sorghum,
  which are grown as feed for livestock and poultry in Europe and North America, are used as food in Africa,
  Asia, and countries of the former Soviet Union. So some cereal crops are excluded from the data for
  some countries and included elsewhere, depending on their use.


  The data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information
  from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites
  of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international
  organizations.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: A cereal is a grass cultivated for the edible components of their grain,
  composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal yield is measured as kilograms per hectare of harvested
  land. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any
  other type of crop; cereal crops therefore can also be called staple crops Cereals production includes
  wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data
  on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested
  green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded.
