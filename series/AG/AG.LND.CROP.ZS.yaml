description: Permanent cropland is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods and
  need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category includes
  land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown
  for wood or timber.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Agricultural land covers more than one-third of the world''s land area. Agricultural
  land constitutes only a part of any country''s total area, which can include areas not suitable for
  agriculture, such as forests, mountains, and inland water bodies.


  Crops are divided into temporary and permanent crops. Permanent crops are sown or planted once, and
  then occupy the land for some years and need not be replanted after each annual harvest, such as cocoa,
  coffee and rubber. This category includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes
  trees grown for wood or timber. Temporary crops are those which are both sown and harvested during the
  same agricultural year, sometimes more than once. Temporary crop land is used for crops with a less
  than one-year growing cycle and which must be newly sown or planted for further production after the
  harvest.


  Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing
  countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources. Poor
  farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Efforts to increase productivity
  by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation have environmental costs and health
  impacts. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers can alter the chemistry of soil. Pesticide poisoning
  is common in developing countries. And salinization of irrigated land diminishes soil fertility. Thus,
  inappropriate use of inputs for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.


  There is significant geographic variation in the availability of land considered suitable for agriculture.
  Increasing population and demand from other sectors place growing pressure on available resources. According
  to FAO, the world''s cultivated area has grown by 12 percent over the last 50 years. The global irrigated
  area has doubled over the same period, accounting for most of the net increase in cultivated land. Agriculture
  already uses 11 percent of the world''s land surface for crop production. It also makes use of 70 percent
  of all water withdrawn from aquifers, streams and lakes. Agricultural policies have primarily benefitted
  farmers with productive land and access to water, bypassing the majority of small-scale producers who
  are still locked in a poverty trap of high vulnerability, land degradation and climatic uncertainty.


  Land resources are central to agriculture and rural development, and are intrinsically linked to global
  challenges of food insecurity and poverty, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as degradation
  and depletion of natural resources that affect the livelihoods of millions of rural people across the
  world.


  In many industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations. In the context
  of zoning, agricultural land (or more properly agriculturally zoned land) refers to plots that may be
  used for agricultural activities, regardless of the physical type or quality of land.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) tries to impose standard definitions
  and reporting methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible. Thus,
  data on agricultural land in different climates may not be comparable. For example, permanent pastures
  are quite different in nature and intensity in African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries.


  True comparability of the data is limited by variations in definitions, statistical methods, and quality
  of data. Countries use different definitions land use. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the
  United Nations (FAO), the primary compiler of the data, occasionally adjusts its definitions of land
  use categories and revises earlier data. Because the data reflect changes in reporting procedures as
  well as actual changes in land use, apparent trends should be interpreted cautiously.


  Satellite images show land use that differs from that of ground-based measures in area under cultivation
  and type of land use. Moreover, land use data in some countries (India is an example) are based on reporting
  systems designed for collecting tax revenue. With land taxes no longer a major source of government
  revenue, the quality and coverage of land use data have declined.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The data on Permanent cropland and land area are collected by the Food
  and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations from official national sources through the
  questionnaire are supplemented with information from official secondary data sources. The secondary
  sources cover official country data from websites of national ministries, national publications and
  related country data reported by various international organizations.
