Developmentrelevance: "PPP can be used to convert national accounts data, like GDP and its expenditure\
  \ components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between\
  \ countries. They can also be used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country\u2019\
  s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.\n\nPPPs and the\
  \ PLIs and real (or PPP-adjusted) expenditures to which they give rise allow for many use-cases, but\
  \ they are particularly valuable for empirical work involving comparisons of per capita consumption\
  \ or levels of GDP (or other GDP aggregates) across countries and for the measurement of global poverty\
  \ and global income inequality. The breadth and depth of ICP data allows its use-cases to cover other\
  \ areas of economics, including empirical analyses of economic growth, productivity and trade, and even\
  \ beyond, for instance, to help track global targets such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals related\
  \ to health, education, energy and emissions and labor. Other applications of ICP data include their\
  \ use in the construction of indexes, for example cost-of-living measures. Uses-cases can even be extended\
  \ into the policymaking domain at all levels (global, regional and national) given the increased importance\
  \ of cross-country benchmarking, among other possibilities.\n\nRecommended uses of PPPs include: To\
  \ make spatial comparisons of GDP and its expenditure components | To make spatial comparisons of price\
  \ levels | To group countries by their per capita volume indexes and price level indexes\n\nRecommended\
  \ uses of PPPs with limitations  include: To analyze changes over time in relative GDP per capita and\
  \ relative prices | To analyze price convergence | To make spatial comparisons of the cost of living\
  \ | To use PPPs calculated for GDP and its expenditure components as deflators for other values."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "PPPs are both currency conversion factors and spatial price indexes.\
  \ PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize\
  \ their purchasing power by controlling differences in price levels between countries.\n\nTypically,\
  \ higher income countries have higher price levels, while lower income countries have lower price levels\
  \ (Balassa-Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure\
  \ components reflect both differences in economic outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences\
  \ in price levels, the size of higher income countries is inflated, while the size of lower income countries\
  \ is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components\
  \ only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume), as PPPs control for price level differences\
  \ between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects the real size of the countries.\n\nThe International\
  \ Comparison Program (ICP) estimates PPPs for the world\u2019s countries. The ICP is conducted as a\
  \ global partnership of countries, multilateral agencies, and academia. The most recent 2017 ICP comparison\
  \ covered 176 countries, including 47 Eurostat-OECD countries. For countries that have not participated\
  \ in ICP comparisons, the PPP are imputed based on a regression model.\n\nICP estimated PPPs cover years\
  \ from 2011 to 2017. WDI extrapolates 2011 PPPs for years earlier years, and 2017 PPPs for later years.\
  \ Description of WDI extrapolation approach is available here: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/665452-how-do-you-extrapolate-the-ppp-conversion-factors\n\
  \nFor the member countries of Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme, PPP conversion factors are periodically updated\
  \ based on the organizations\u2019 databases. For Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme, please refer to the following\

description: Purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency
  converter that controls for price level differences between countries, thereby allowing volume comparisons
  of gross domestic product (GDP) and its expenditure components. This conversion factor is for GDP.
