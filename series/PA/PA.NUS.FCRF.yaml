Developmentrelevance: In a market-based economy, household, producer, and government choices about resource
  allocation are influenced by relative prices, including the real exchange rate, real wages, real interest
  rates, and other prices in the economy. Relative prices also largely reflect these agents' choices.
  Thus relative prices convey vital information about the interaction of economic agents in an economy
  and with the rest of the world.

Limitationsandexceptions: Official or market exchange rates are often used to convert economic statistics
  in local currencies to a common currency in order to make comparisons across countries. Since market
  rates reflect at best the relative prices of tradable goods, the volume of goods and services that a
  U.S. dollar buys in the United States may not correspond to what a U.S. dollar converted to another
  country's currency at the official exchange rate would buy in that country, particularly when nontradable
  goods and services account for a significant share of a country's output. An alternative exchange rate
  - the purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor - is preferred because it reflects differences
  in price levels for both tradable and nontradable goods and services and therefore provides a more meaningful
  comparison of real output.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another.
  Official exchange rates and exchange rate arrangements are established by governments. Other exchange
  rates recognized by governments include market rates, which are determined largely by legal market forces,
  and for countries with multiple exchange arrangements, principal rates, secondary rates, and tertiary
  rates.
