description: Contraceptive prevalence, any method is the percentage of married women ages 15-49 who are
  practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, any method of contraception (modern or traditional).
  Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, the intra-uterine
  device (IUD), the male condom, injectables, the implant (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods,
  the female condom and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g.,
  fertility awareness based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: "Contraceptive prevalence among women of reproductive age is related to maternal
   and child health, as well as gender equality and HIV/AIDS.   Contraceptives enable women and men to
   make informed decisions on family planning \u2013 whether, when, and how many children they would have.
   \n\nPreventing unwanted pregnancies is essential to reducing maternal deaths, especially in low- and
   middle- income countries where maternal mortality rate is high.  With effective contraception, life-threatening
   pregnancy complications can be reduced, and thus maternal deaths can be averted.  \n\nUsing condoms
   (one of the modern contraceptive methods) can prevent pregnancy as well as sexually transmitted diseases,
   including HIV."

Limitationsandexceptions: "While the data availability on contraceptive use has increased, in many countries
   the contraceptive use data are available only for married women. \n\nThe time frame used to assess
   contraceptive prevalence may vary. In many surveys, it is left to the respondent to determine what
   is meant by \u201Ccurrently using\u201D a method of contraception."
Othernotes: 'As of December 2021, for better consistency the contraceptive prevalence data only for currently
  married women or in union are included in this indicator. It means the data for the following categories
  are excluded from this indicator: ever-married women; all women; sexually active women; which data may
  have been included in this indicator before December 2021. In response to this, two new contraceptive
  prevalence indicators (any method and any modern method) for sexually active unmarried women 15-49 are
  added to the WDI.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Contraceptive prevalence rates are obtained mainly from nationally
   representative household surveys, including: Demographic and Health Surveys; Multiple Indicator Cluster
   Surveys; Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys; Gender and Generations Survey; Reproductive Health Surveys;
   and World Fertility Surveys.  Additional information was provided by other international survey programs
   and national surveys.  \n\nMarried women refer to women who are married (defined in relation to the
   marriage laws or customs of a country) and to women in a union, which refers to women living with their
   partner in the same household (also referred to as cohabiting unions, consensual unions, unmarried
   unions, or \u201Cliving together\u201D)."
