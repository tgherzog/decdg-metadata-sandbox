Developmentrelevance: Having a child during the teenage years limits girls' opportunities for better education,
  jobs, and income. Pregnancy is more likely to be unintended during the teenage years, and births are
  more likely to be premature and are associated with greater risks of complications during delivery and
  of death. In many countries maternal mortality is a leading cause of death among women of reproductive
  age, although most of those deaths are preventable. Infants of adolescent mothers are also more likely
  to have low birth weight, which can have a long-term impact on their health and development. Complications
  from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19 years in many low-
  and middle-income countries.
