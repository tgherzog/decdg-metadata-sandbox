Limitationsandexceptions: Estimates of the resources allocated to R&D are affected by national characteristics
  such as the periodicity and coverage of national R&D surveys across institutional sectors and industries;
  and the use of different sampling and estimation methods. R&D typically involves a few large performers,
  hence R&D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while
  attempting to identify new or occasional performers.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Technicians in research and development (R&D) are persons whose main\
  \ tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, physical and\
  \ life sciences, or social sciences and humanities. \n\nThe OECD's Frascati Manual defines research\
  \ and experimental development as \"creative work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase\
  \ the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock\
  \ of knowledge to devise new applications.\" R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental\
  \ development.\n\n(1) Basic research - Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken\
  \ primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts,\
  \ without any particular application or use in view.\n\n(2) Applied research - Applied research is also\
  \ original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily\
  \ towards a specific practical aim or objective.\n\n(3) Experimental development - Experimental development\
  \ is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience,\
  \ which is directed to producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems\
  \ and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.\n\nThe fields of\
  \ science and technology used to classify R&D according to the Revised Fields of Science and Technology\
  \ Classification are:\n1. Natural sciences;\n2. Engineering and technology;\n3. Medical and health sciences;\n\
  4. Agricultural sciences;\n5. Social sciences;\n6. Humanities and the arts.\n\nData are for full-time\
  \ equivalent (FTE); the FTE of R&D personnel is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent\
  \ on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of\
  \ hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. \n\nThe data are obtained\
  \ through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering R&D performing\
  \ entities in the private and public sectors."

description: The number of technicians participated in Research & Development (R&D), expressed as per
  million. Technicians and equivalent staff are people who perform scientific and technical tasks involving
  the application of concepts and operational methods, normally under the supervision of researchers.
  R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.
