description: The number of technicians participated in Research & Development (R&D), expressed as per
  million. Technicians and equivalent staff are people who perform scientific and technical tasks involving
  the application of concepts and operational methods, normally under the supervision of researchers.
  R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.

Limitationsandexceptions: Estimates of the resources allocated to R&D are affected by national characteristics
  such as the periodicity and coverage of national R&D surveys across institutional sectors and industries;
  and the use of different sampling and estimation methods. R&D typically involves a few large performers,
  hence R&D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while
  attempting to identify new or occasional performers.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Technicians in research and development (R&D) are persons whose main
  tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, physical and
  life sciences, or social sciences and humanities. 


  The OECD''s Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as "creative work undertaken
  on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture
  and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications." R&D covers basic research,
  applied research, and experimental development.


  (1) Basic research - Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire
  new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular
  application or use in view.


  (2) Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire
  new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.


  (3) Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge
  gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products
  or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already
  produced or installed.


  The fields of science and technology used to classify R&D according to the Revised Fields of Science
  and Technology Classification are:

  1. Natural sciences;

  2. Engineering and technology;

  3. Medical and health sciences;

  4. Agricultural sciences;

  5. Social sciences;

  6. Humanities and the arts.


  Data are for full-time equivalent (FTE); the FTE of R&D personnel is defined as the ratio of working
  hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by
  the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. 


  The data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering
  R&D performing entities in the private and public sectors.'
