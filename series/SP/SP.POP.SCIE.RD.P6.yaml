description: The number of researchers engaged in Research &Development (R&D), expressed as per million.
  Researchers are professionals who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models
  techniques instrumentation, software of operational methods. R&D covers basic research, applied research,
  and experimental development.

Limitationsandexceptions: Estimates of the resources allocated to R&D are affected by national characteristics
  such as the periodicity and coverage of national R&D surveys across institutional sectors and industries;
  and the use of different sampling and estimation methods. R&D typically involves a few large performers,
  hence R&D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while
  attempting to identify new or occasional performers.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation
   of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, as well as in the management of these projects.
   Students studying at the master\u2019s or doctoral level (ISCED2011 level 7 or 8) engaged in R&D are
   included. \n\nThe OECD's Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as \"creative
   work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge
   of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\" R&D
   covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.\n\n(1) Basic research - Basic
   research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying
   foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.\n\n\
  (2) Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire
   new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.\n\n\
  (3) Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge
   gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products
   or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those
   already produced or installed.\n\nThe fields of science and technology used to classify R&D according
   to the Revised Fields of Science and Technology Classification are:\n1. Natural sciences;\n2. Engineering
   and technology;\n3. Medical and health sciences;\n4. Agricultural sciences;\n5. Social sciences;\n\
  6. Humanities and the arts.\n\nData are for full-time equivalent (FTE); the FTE of R&D personnel is
   defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually
   a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an
   individual or by a group. \n\nThe data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly
   conducted at national level covering R&D performing entities in the private and public sectors."
