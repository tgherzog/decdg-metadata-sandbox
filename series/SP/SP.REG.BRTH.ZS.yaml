Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Health systems - the combined arrangements of institutions and actions
  whose primary purpose is to promote, restore, or maintain health (World Health Organization, World Health
  Report 2000) - are increasingly being recognized as key to combating disease and improving the health
  status of populations. The World Bank''s Healthy Development: Strategy for Health, Nutrition, and Population
  Results emphasizes the need to strengthen health systems, which are weak in many countries, in order
  to increase the effectiveness of programs aimed at reducing specific diseases and further reduce morbidity
  and mortality. To evaluate health systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that
  key components - such as financing, service delivery, workforce, governance, and information - be monitored
  using several key indicators. The data are a subset of the key indicators. Monitoring health systems
  allows the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of different health system models to be compared. Health
  system data also help identify weaknesses and strengths and areas that need investment, such as additional
  health facilities, better health information systems, or better trained human resources.


  Numerous indicators have been proposed to assess a country''s health information system.They can be
  grouped into two broad types: indicators related to data generation using core sources and methods (health
  surveys, civil registration, censuses, facility reporting, health system resource tracking) and indicators
  related to capacity for data synthesis, analysis, and validation. Indicators related to data generation
  reflect a country''s capacity to collect relevant data at suitable intervals using the most appropriate
  data sources. Benchmarks include periodicity, timeliness, contents, and availability. Indicators related
  to capacity for synthesis, analysis, and validation measure the dimensions of the institutional frameworks
  needed to ensure data quality, including independence, transparency, and access. Benchmarks include
  the availability of independent coordination mechanisms and micro- and meta-data. Indicators related
  to data generation include completeness of birth registration.


  Birth registration refers to the permanent and official recording of a child''s existence by some administrative
  levels of the State that is normally coordinated by a particular branch of the government.


  Completeness of birth registration indicator is related to the group of indictors of data generation.'
