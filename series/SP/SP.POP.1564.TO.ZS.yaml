description: Total population between the ages 15 to 64 as a percentage of the total population. Population
  is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status
  or citizenship.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Patterns of development in a country are partly determined by the age composition
  of its population. Different age groups have different impacts on both the environment and on infrastructure
  needs.  Therefore the age structure of a population is useful for analyzing resource use and formulating
  future policy and planning goals  with regards infrastructure and development.


  This indicator is used for calculating age dependency ratio (percent of working-age population). The
  age dependency ratio is the ratio of the sum of the population aged 0-14 and the population aged 65
  and above to the population aged 15-64. In many developing countries, the once rapidly growing population
  group of the under-15 population is shrinking. As a result, high fertility rates, together with declining
  mortality rates, are now reflected in the larger share of the 65 and older population.'
