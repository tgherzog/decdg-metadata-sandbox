description: Infant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per
  1,000 live births in a given year.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall
  mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators
  of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently
  unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the
  indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.
Generalcomments: 'Given that data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable,
  mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. Moreover, they are among the indicators
  most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries. Under-five mortality rates
  are higher for boys than for girls in countries in which parental gender preferences are insignificant.
  Under-five mortality captures the effect of gender discrimination better than infant mortality does,
  as malnutrition and medical interventions have more significant impacts to this age group. Where female
  under-five mortality is higher, girls are likely to have less access to resources than boys.


  Aggregate data for LIC, UMC, LMC, HIC are computed based on the groupings for the World Bank fiscal
  year in which the data was released by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Complete vital registration systems are fairly uncommon in developing countries.
  Thus estimates must be obtained from sample surveys or derived by applying indirect estimation techniques
  to registration, census, or survey data. Survey data are subject to recall error, and surveys estimating
  infant/child deaths require large samples because households in which a birth has occurred during a
  given year cannot ordinarily be preselected for sampling. Indirect estimates rely on model life tables
  that may be inappropriate for the population concerned. Extrapolations based on outdated surveys may
  not be reliable for monitoring changes in health status or for comparative analytical work.
Periodicity: Annual

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The main sources of mortality data are vital registration systems and
  direct or indirect estimates based on sample surveys or censuses. A "complete" vital registration system
  - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific
  mortality data.


  Estimates of neonatal, infant, and child mortality tend to vary by source and method for a given time
  and place. Years for available estimates also vary by country, making comparisons across countries and
  over time difficult. To make neonatal, infant, and child mortality estimates comparable and to ensure
  consistency across estimates by different agencies, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child
  Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which comprises the United Nations Children''s Fund (UNICEF), the World
  Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the United Nations Population Division, and other universities
  and research institutes, developed and adopted a statistical method that uses all available information
  to reconcile differences. The method uses statistical models to obtain a best estimate trend line by
  fitting a country-specific regression model of mortality rates against their reference dates.'
