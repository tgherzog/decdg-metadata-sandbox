Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Reproductive health is a state of physical and mental well-being in
  relation to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Means of achieving reproductive
  health include education and services during pregnancy and childbirth, safe and effective contraception,
  and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth
  are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries.


  Adolescent fertility rates are based on data on registered live births from vital registration systems
  or, in the absence of such systems, from censuses or sample surveys. The estimated rates are generally
  considered reliable measures of fertility in the recent past. Where no empirical information on age-specific
  fertility rates is available, a model is used to estimate the share of births to adolescents. For countries
  without vital registration systems fertility rates are generally based on extrapolations from trends
  observed in censuses or surveys from earlier years.'
