Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Patterns of development in a country are partly determined by the age composition
  of its population. Different age groups have different impacts on both the environment and on infrastructure
  needs.  Therefore the age structure of a population is useful for analyzing resource use and formulating
  future policy and planning goals  with regards infrastructure and development.
Generalcomments: 'Relevance to gender indicator: this indicator implies the dependency burden that the
  working-age population bears in relation to children and the elderly. Many times single or widowed women
  who are the sole caregiver of a household have a high dependency ratio.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Because the five-year age group is the cohort unit and five-year period data
  are used in the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects, interpolations to obtain
  annual data or single age structure may not reflect actual events or age composition. For more information,

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Dependency ratios capture variations in the proportions of children,
  elderly people, and working-age people in the population that imply the dependency burden that the working-age
  population bears in relation to children and the elderly. But dependency ratios show only the age composition
  of a population, not economic dependency. Some children and elderly people are part of the labor force,
  and many working-age people are not.

description: Age dependency ratio is the ratio of dependents--people younger than 15 or older than 64--to
  the working-age population--those ages 15-64. Data are shown as the proportion of dependents per 100
  working-age population.
