description: Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing
  patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall
  mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators
  of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently
  unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the
  indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Life expectancy at birth used here is the average number of years a
  newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future.
  It reflects the overall mortality level of a population, and summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails
  across all age groups in a given year. It is calculated in a period life table which provides a snapshot
  of a population''s mortality pattern at a given time. It therefore does not reflect the mortality pattern
  that a person actually experiences during his/her life, which can be calculated in a cohort life table.


  High mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person
  survives his/her childhood of high mortality, he/she may live much longer. For example, in a population
  with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50. The life expectancy
  at birth may be low due to the high childhood mortality so that once a person survives his/her childhood,
  he/she may live much longer than 50 years.'
