Developmentrelevance: 'The International Development Association (IDA) is the part of the World Bank Group
  that helps the poorest countries reduce poverty by providing concessional loans and grants for programs
  aimed at boosting economic growth and improving living conditions. IDA funding helps these countries
  deal with the complex challenges they face in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.


  The World Bank''s IDA Resource Allocation Index (IRAI) is based on the results of the annual Country
  Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) exercise, which covers the IDA-eligible countries. Country
  assessments have been carried out annually since the mid-1970s by World Bank staff. Over time the criteria
  have been revised from a largely macroeconomic focus to include governance aspects and a broader coverage
  of social and structural dimensions. Country performance is assessed against a set of 16 criteria grouped
  into four clusters: economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion and equity,
  and public sector management and institutions. IDA resources are allocated to a country on per capita
  terms based on its IDA country performance rating and, to a limited extent, based on its per capita
  gross national income. This ensures that good performers receive a higher IDA allocation in per capita
  terms. The IRAI is a key element in the country performance rating.'

Limitationsandexceptions: The CPIA exercise is intended to capture the quality of a country's policies
  and institutional arrangements, focusing on key elements that are within the country's control, rather
  than on outcomes (such as economic growth rates) that are influenced by events beyond the country's
  control. More specifically, the CPIA measures the extent to which a country's policy and institutional
  framework supports sustainable growth and poverty reduction and, consequently, the effective use of
  development assistance.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'All criteria within each cluster receive equal weight, and each cluster
  has a 25 percent weight in the overall score, which is obtained by averaging the average scores of the
  four clusters. For each of the 16 criteria countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The
  scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than
  on changes in performance compared with the previous year. All 16 CPIA criteria contain a detailed description
  of each rating level. In assessing country performance, World Bank staff evaluate the country''s performance
  on each of the criteria and assign a rating. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations,
  and judgments based on country knowledge and on relevant publicly available indicators. In interpreting
  the assessment scores, it should be noted that the criteria are designed in a developmentally neutral
  manner. Accordingly, higher scores can be attained by a country that, given its stage of development,
  has a policy and institutional framework that more strongly fosters growth and poverty reduction.


  The country teams that prepare the ratings are very familiar with the country, and their assessments
  are based on country diagnostic studies prepared by the World Bank or other development organizations
  and on their own professional judgment. An early consultation is conducted with country authorities
  to make sure that the assessments are informed by up-to-date information. To ensure that scores are
  consistent across countries, the process involves two key phases. In the benchmarking phase a small
  representative sample of countries drawn from all regions is rated. Country teams prepare proposals
  that are reviewed first at the regional level and then in a Bankwide review process. A similar process
  is followed to assess the performance of the remaining countries, using the benchmark countries'' scores
  as guideposts. The final ratings are determined following a Bankwide review. The overall numerical IRAI
  score and the separate criteria scores were first publicly disclosed in June 2006.'
