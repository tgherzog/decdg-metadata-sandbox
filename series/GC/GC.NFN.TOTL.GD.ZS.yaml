Limitationsandexceptions: 'For most countries central government finance data have been consolidated into
  one account, but for others only budgetary central government accounts are available. Countries reporting
  budgetary data are noted in the country metadata. Because budgetary accounts may not include all central
  government units (such as social security funds), they usually provide an incomplete picture. In federal
  states the central government accounts provide an incomplete view of total public finance.


  Data on government revenue and expense are collected by the IMF through questionnaires to member countries
  and by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Despite IMF efforts to standardize
  data collection, statistics are often incomplete, untimely, and not comparable across countries.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The IMF''s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014, harmonized with
  the 2008 SNA, recommends an accrual accounting method, focusing on all economic events affecting assets,
  liabilities, revenues, and expenses, not just those represented by cash transactions. It accounts for
  all changes in stocks, so stock data at the end of an accounting period equal stock data at the beginning
  of the period plus flows over the period. The 1986 manual considered only debt stocks.


  Government finance statistics are reported in local currency. Many countries report government finance
  data by fiscal year; see country metadata for information on fiscal year end by country.'
