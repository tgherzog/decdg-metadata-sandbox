description: Intentional homicides are estimates of unlawful homicides purposely inflicted as a result
  of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence
  over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups. Intentional homicide does
  not include all intentional killing; the difference is usually in the organization of the killing. Individuals
  or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly
  cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded.

Developmentrelevance: 'In some regions, organized crime, drug trafficking and the violent cultures of
  youth gangs are predominantly responsible for the high levels of homicide. There has been a sharp increase
  in homicides in some countries, particularly in Central America, are making the activities of organized
  crime and drug trafficking more visible. Greater use of firearms is often associated with the illicit
  activities of organized criminal groups, which are often linked to drug trafficking.


  Knowledge of the patterns and causes of violent crime are crucial to forming preventive strategies.
  Young males are the group most affected by violent crime in all regions, particularly in the Americas.
  Yet women of all ages are the victims of intimate partner and family-related violence in all regions
  and countries. Indeed, in many of them, it is within the home where a woman is most likely to be killed.


  Data on intentional homicides are from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which uses
  a variety of national and international sources on homicides - primarily criminal justice sources as
  well as public health data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization
  - and the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems to present
  accurate and comparable statistics. The UNODC defines homicide as "unlawful death purposefully inflicted
  on a person by another person." This definition excludes deaths arising from armed conflict.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Statistics reported to the United Nations in the context of its various surveys
  on crime levels and criminal justice trends are incidents of victimization that have been reported to
  the authorities in any given country. That means that this data is subject to the problems of accuracy
  of all official crime data. The survey results provide an overview of trends and interrelationships
  between various parts of the criminal justice system to promote informed decision-making in administration,
  nationally and internationally.


  The degree to which different societies apportion the level of culpability to acts resulting in death
  is also subject to variation. Consequently, the comparison between countries and regions of "intentional
  homicide", or unlawful death purposefully inflicted on a person by another person, is also a comparison
  of the extent to which different countries deem that a killing be classified as such, as well as the
  capacity of their legal systems to record it. Caution should therefore be applied when evaluating and
  comparing homicide data.'

  The definitions used to produce data are in line with the homicide definition used in the UNODC Homicide
  Statistics dataset. On the basis of these selection criteria and subject to data availability, a long
  and continuous time series including recent data on homicide counts and rates has been identified or
  created at country level. Data included in the dataset correspond to the original value provided by
  the source of origin, since no statistical procedure or modeling was used to change collected values
  or to create new or revised figures.


  The intentional killing of a human being by another is the ultimate crime. Its indisputable physical
  consequences manifested in the form of a dead body also make it the most categorical and calculable.
  All existing data sources on intentional homicides, both at national and international level, stem from
  either criminal justice or public health systems. In the former case, data are generated by law enforcement
  or criminal justice authorities in the process of recording and investigating a crime event. In the
  latter, data are produced by health authorities certifying the cause of death of an individual.
   
  Criminal justice data were collected through UNODC regular collections of crime data from Member States,
  through publicly available data produced by national government sources and from data compiled by other
  international and regional agencies, including from Interpol, Eurostat, the Organization of American
  States and UNICEF. Public health data on homicides were mainly derived from databases on deaths by cause
  disseminated by the World Health Organization (WHO).


  The inclusion of recent data was given a higher priority in the selection process than the length of
  the time series (number of years covered). An analysis of official reports and research literature is
  regularly carried out to verify homicide data used by government agencies and the scientific community.


  As a result of the data collection and validation process, in many countries several homicide datasets
  have become available from different or multiple sources. Therefore, data series have been selected
  to provide the most appropriate reference counts.
