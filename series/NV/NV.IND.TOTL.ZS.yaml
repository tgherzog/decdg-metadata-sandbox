Limitationsandexceptions: Ideally, industrial output should be measured through regular censuses and surveys
  of firms. But in most developing countries such surveys are infrequent, so earlier survey results must
  be extrapolated using an appropriate indicator. The choice of sampling unit, which may be the enterprise
  (where responses may be based on financial records) or the establishment (where production units may
  be recorded separately), also affects the quality of the data. Moreover, much industrial production
  is organized in unincorporated or owner-operated ventures that are not captured by surveys aimed at
  the formal sector. Even in large industries, where regular surveys are more likely, evasion of excise
  and other taxes and nondisclosure of income lower the estimates of value added. Such problems become
  more acute as countries move from state control of industry to private enterprise, because new firms
  and growing numbers of established firms fail to report. In accordance with the System of National Accounts,
  output should include all such unreported activity as well as the value of illegal activities and other
  unrecorded, informal, or small-scale operations. Data on these activities need to be collected using
  techniques other than conventional surveys of firms.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the sum of value added by all
  its producers. Value added is the value of the gross output of producers less the value of intermediate
  goods and services consumed in production, before accounting for consumption of fixed capital in production.
  The United Nations System of National Accounts calls for value added to be valued at either basic prices
  (excluding net taxes on products) or producer prices (including net taxes on products paid by producers
  but excluding sales or value added taxes). Both valuations exclude transport charges that are invoiced
  separately by producers. Total GDP is measured at purchaser prices. Value added by industry is normally
  measured at basic prices.

description: 'Industry corresponds to ISIC divisions 10-45 and includes manufacturing (ISIC divisions
  15-37). It comprises value added in mining, manufacturing (also reported as a separate subgroup), construction,
  electricity, water, and gas. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and
  subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated
  assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The origin of value added is determined by
  the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 3. Note: For VAB countries, gross
  value added at factor cost is used as the denominator.'
