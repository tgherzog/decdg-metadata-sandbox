description: 'Agriculture, forestry, and fishing corresponds to ISIC divisions 1-3 and includes forestry,
  hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net
  output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated
  without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural
  resources. The origin of value added is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification
  (ISIC), revision 4. Note: For VAB countries, gross value added at factor cost is used as the denominator.'
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Generalcomments: 'Note: Data for OECD countries are based on ISIC, revision 4.'

Limitationsandexceptions: Among the difficulties faced by compilers of national accounts is the extent
  of unreported economic activity in the informal or secondary economy. In developing countries a large
  share of agricultural output is either not exchanged (because it is consumed within the household) or
  not exchanged for money. Agricultural production often must be estimated indirectly, using a combination
  of methods involving estimates of inputs, yields, and area under cultivation. This approach sometimes
  leads to crude approximations that can differ from the true values over time and across crops for reasons
  other than climate conditions or farming techniques. Similarly, agricultural inputs that cannot easily
  be allocated to specific outputs are frequently "netted out" using equally crude and ad hoc approximations.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the sum of value added by all
  its producers. Value added is the value of the gross output of producers less the value of intermediate
  goods and services consumed in production, before accounting for consumption of fixed capital in production.
  The United Nations System of National Accounts calls for value added to be valued at either basic prices
  (excluding net taxes on products) or producer prices (including net taxes on products paid by producers
  but excluding sales or value added taxes). Both valuations exclude transport charges that are invoiced
  separately by producers. Total GDP is measured at purchaser prices. Value added by industry is normally
  measured at basic prices.
