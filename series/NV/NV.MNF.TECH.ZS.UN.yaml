Developmentrelevance: Industrial development generally entails a structural transition from resource-based
  and low technology activities to medium and high-tech industry (MHT) activities. A modern, highly complex
  production structure offers better opportunities for skills development and technological innovation.
  MHT activities are also the high value addition industries of manufacturing with higher technological
  intensity and labour productivity. Increasing the share of MHT sectors also reflects the impact of innovation

  for compiling MHT values. Missing values at country level are imputed based on the methodology from
  Competitive Industrial Performance Report (UNIDO, 2017. Conversion to USD or difference in ISIC combinations
  may cause discrepancy between national and international figures. For additional information please

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The indicator is calculated as the share of the sum of the value added
  from medium and high-tech industry economic activities to manufacturing value added. The medium and
  high-tech industry is defined using OECD classification as the following by International Standard Industrial
  Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3 and Revision 4 Division respectively: ISIC
  Rev. 3 (24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 excluding 351). Manufacturing value added is the value added
  of manufacturing industry, which is Section C of ISIC Rev.4, and Section D of ISIC Rev.3.  Data can
  be found in UNIDO INDSTAT4 Database by ISIC Revision 3 and ISIC Revision 4 respectively. Data are collected
  using General Industrial Statistics Questionnaire which is filled by NSOs and submitted to UNIDO annually.
  Data for OECD countries are obtained directly from OECD. Country data are also collected from official
  publications and official web-sites. For additional information please see Table B.2.2 in Appendix B
  of UNIDO (2017): http://stat.unido.org/content/publications/volume-i%252c-competitive-industrial-performance-report-2016'
