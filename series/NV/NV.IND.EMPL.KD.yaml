Developmentrelevance: "Labor productivity is used to assess a country's economic ability to create and\
  \ sustain decent employment opportunities with fair and equitable remuneration. Productivity increases\
  \ obtained through investment, trade, technological progress, or changes in work organization can increase\
  \ social protection and reduce poverty, which in turn reduce vulnerable employment and working poverty.\
  \ Productivity increases do not guarantee these improvements, but without them\u2014and the economic\
  \ growth they bring\u2014improvements are highly unlikely. Please also see GDP per person employed (constant\
  \ 2011 PPP $) [SL.GDP.PCAP.EM.KD], which is a key measure for monitoring the Sustainable Development\
  \ Goal 8 of promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment\
  \ and decent work for all."

Limitationsandexceptions: For comparability of individual sectors labor productivity is estimated according
  to national accounts conventions. However, there are still significant limitations on the availability
  of reliable data. Information on consistent series of output is not easily available, especially in
  low- and middle-income countries, because the definition, coverage, and methodology are not always consistent
  across countries. For more details, see Agriculture, value added (constant 2010 US$) [NV.AGR.TOTL.KD],
  Industry, value added (constant 2010 US$) [NV.IND.TOTL.KD], and Services, etc., value added (constant
  2010 US$) [NV.SRV.TOTL.KD].

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Value added per worker is calculated by dividing value added of a sector\
  \ by the number employed in the sector.  \nGross domestic product (GDP) represents the sum of value\
  \ added by all producers. Value added is the value of the gross output of producers less the value of\
  \ intermediate goods and services consumed in production, before accounting for consumption of fixed\
  \ capital in production. The United Nations System of National Accounts calls for value added to be\
  \ valued at either basic prices (excluding net taxes on products) or producer prices (including net\
  \ taxes on products paid by producers but excluding sales or value added taxes). Both valuations exclude\
  \ transport charges that are invoiced separately by producers. Value added by industry is normally measured\
  \ at basic prices, while total GDP is measured at purchaser prices. \nData on employment are modeled\
  \ estimates by the International Labour Organization (ILO) ILOSTAT database. The concept of employment\
  \ generally refers to people above a certain age who worked, or who held a job, during a reference period.\
  \ Employment data include both full-time and part-time workers."
