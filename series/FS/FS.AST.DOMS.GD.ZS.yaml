Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Both banking and financial systems enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction.
  At low levels of economic development commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while
  at higher levels domestic stock markets tend to become more active and efficient. The size and mobility
  of international capital flows make it increasingly important to monitor the strength of financial systems.
  Robust financial systems can increase economic activity and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial
  activity and impose widespread costs on the economy.

Limitationsandexceptions: In a few countries governments may hold international reserves as deposits in
  the banking system rather than in the central bank. Since claims on the central government are a net
  item (claims on the central government minus central government deposits), the figure may be negative,
  resulting in a negative figure for domestic credit provided by the banking sector.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Domestic credit provided by the financial sector as a share of GDP measures
  banking sector depth and financial sector development in terms of size. The data on domestic credit
  provided by the financial sector are taken from the financial corporations survey (line 52) of the International
  Monetary Fund's (IMF) International Financial Statistics or, when unavailable, from its depository corporations
  survey (line 32). The financial sector includes monetary authorities (the central bank) and deposit
  money banks, as well as other financial institutions where data are available (including institutions
  that do not accept transferable deposits but do incur such liabilities as time and savings deposits).
  Examples of other banking institutions are savings and mortgage loan institutions, finance companies,
  development banks, and building and loan associations.
