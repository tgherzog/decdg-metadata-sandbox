description: Domestic credit to private sector refers to financial resources provided to the private sector
  by financial corporations, such as through loans, purchases of nonequity securities, and trade credits
  and other accounts receivable, that establish a claim for repayment. For some countries these claims
  include credit to public enterprises. The financial corporations include monetary authorities and deposit
  money banks, as well as other financial corporations where data are available (including corporations
  that do not accept transferable deposits but do incur such liabilities as time and savings deposits).
  Examples of other financial corporations are finance and leasing companies, money lenders, insurance
  corporations, pension funds, and foreign exchange companies.

Developmentrelevance: Private sector development and investment - tapping private sector initiative and
  investment for socially useful purposes - are critical for poverty reduction. In parallel with public
  sector efforts, private investment, especially in competitive markets, has tremendous potential to contribute
  to growth. Private markets are the engine of productivity growth, creating productive jobs and higher
  incomes. And with government playing a complementary role of regulation, funding, and service provision,
  private initiative and investment can help provide the basic services and conditions that empower poor
  people - by improving health, education, and infrastructure.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Credit is an important link in money transmission; it finances production,
  consumption, and capital formation, which in turn affect economic activity. The data on domestic credit
  provided to the private sector are taken from the financial corporations survey (line 52D) of the International
  Monetary Fund's (IMF) International Financial Statistics or, when unavailable, from its depository survey
  (line 32D). The banking sector includes monetary authorities (the central bank) and deposit money banks,
  as well as other financial corporations where data are available (including institutions that do not
  accept transferable deposits but do incur such liabilities as time and savings deposits). Examples of
  other financial corporations are finance and leasing companies, money lenders, insurance corporations,
  pension funds, and foreign exchange companies.
