description: Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans are the value of nonperforming loans divided
  by the total value of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming loans before the deduction of specific
  loan-loss provisions). The loan amount recorded as nonperforming should be the gross value of the loan
  as recorded on the balance sheet, not just the amount that is overdue.
Developmentrelevance: The size and mobility of international capital flows make it increasingly important
  to monitor the strength of financial systems. Robust financial systems can increase economic activity
  and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial activity and impose widespread costs on the economy.
  The ratio of bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans measures bank health and efficiency by identifying
  problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio. A high ratio may signal deterioration of the credit
  portfolio.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The ratio of bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans is the value
  of nonperforming loans (gross value of the loan as recorded on the balance sheet) divided by the total
  value of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming loans before the deduction of loan loss provisions).
  It measures bank health and efficiency by identifying problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.
  International guidelines recommend that loans be classified as nonperforming when payments of principal
  and interest are 90 days or more past due or when future payments are not expected to be received in
  full. Data are submitted by national authorities to the IMF following the Financial Soundness Indicators
  (FSI) Compilation Guide. For country specific metadata, including reporting period, please refer to
  the GFSR FSI Tables and the Data and Metadata Tables available through FSIs website: http://data.imf.org/.'
