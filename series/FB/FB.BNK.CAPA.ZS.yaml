Developmentrelevance: The size and mobility of international capital flows make it increasingly important
  to monitor the strength of financial systems. Robust financial systems can increase economic activity
  and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial activity and impose widespread costs on the economy.
  The ratio of bank capital to assets, a measure of bank solvency and resiliency, shows the extent to
  which banks can deal with unexpected losses. Capital includes tier 1 capital (paid-up shares and common
  stock), a common feature in all countries' banking systems, and total regulatory capital, which includes
  several types of subordinated debt instruments that need not be repaid if the funds are required to
  maintain minimum capital levels (tier 2 and tier 3 capital). Total assets include all nonfinancial and
  financial assets. Data are from internally consistent financial statements.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The ratio of capital to total assets, without the latter being risk
  weighted. Capital is measured as total capital and reserves as reported in the sectoral balance sheet;
  for cross-border consolidated data, Tier 1 capital can also be used. It indicates the extent to which
  assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the deposit-taking
  sector. It complements the capital adequacy ratios compiled based on the methodology agreed to by the
  Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. Also, it measures financial leverage and is sometimes called
  the leverage ratio. Data are submitted by national authorities to the IMF following the Financial Soundness
  Indicators (FSI) Compilation Guide. For country specific metadata, including reporting period, please
