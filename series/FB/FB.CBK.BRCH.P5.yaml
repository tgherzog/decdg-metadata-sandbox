Developmentrelevance: 'Access to finance can expand opportunities for all with higher levels of access
  and use of banking services associated with lower financing obstacles for people and businesses. A stable
  financial system that promotes efficient savings and investment is also crucial for a thriving democracy
  and market economy. There are several aspects of access to financial services: availability, cost, and
  quality of services. The development and growth of credit markets depend on access to timely, reliable,
  and accurate data on borrowers'' credit experiences. Access to credit can be improved by making it easy
  to create and enforce collateral agreements and by increasing information about potential borrowers''
  creditworthiness. Lenders look at a borrower''s credit history and collateral. Where credit registries
  and effective collateral laws are absent - as in many developing countries - banks make fewer loans.
  Indicators that cover getting credit include the strength of legal rights index and the depth of credit
  information index.'
