description: Current account balance is the sum of net exports of goods and services, net primary income,
  and net secondary income. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
Developmentrelevance: "The balance of payments records an economy\u2019s transactions with the rest of
   the world. Balance of payments accounts are divided into two groups: the current account, which records
   transactions in goods, services, primary income, and secondary income, and the capital and financial
   account, which records capital transfers, acquisition or disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets,
   and transactions in financial assets and liabilities. The current account balance is one of the most
   analytically useful indicators of an external imbalance.\n\nA primary purpose of the balance of payments
   accounts is to indicate the need to adjust an external imbalance. Where to draw the line for analytical
   purposes requires a judgment concerning the imbalance that best indicates the need for adjustment.
   There are a number of definitions in common use for this and related analytical purposes. The trade
   balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods. From an analytical view it is arbitrary
   to distinguish goods from services. For example, a unit of foreign exchange earned by a freight company
   strengthens the balance of payments to the same extent as the foreign exchange earned by a goods exporter.
   Even so, the trade balance is useful because it is often the most timely indicator of trends in the
   current account balance. Customs authorities are typically able to provide data on trade in goods long
   before data on trade in services are available."

Limitationsandexceptions: Discrepancies may arise in the balance of payments because there is no single
  source for balance of payments data and therefore no way to ensure that the data are fully consistent.
  Sources include customs data, monetary accounts of the banking system, external debt records, information
  provided by enterprises, surveys to estimate service transactions, and foreign exchange records. Differences
  in collection methods - such as in timing, definitions of residence and ownership, and the exchange
  rate used to value transactions - contribute to net errors and omissions. In addition, smuggling and
  other illegal or quasi-legal transactions may be unrecorded or misrecorded.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The balance of payments (BoP) is a double-entry accounting system that
  shows all flows of goods and services into and out of an economy; all transfers that are the counterpart
  of real resources or financial claims provided to or by the rest of the world without a quid pro quo,
  such as donations and grants; and all changes in residents'' claims on and liabilities to nonresidents
  that arise from economic transactions. All transactions are recorded twice - once as a credit and once
  as a debit. In principle the net balance should be zero, but in practice the accounts often do not balance,
  requiring inclusion of a balancing item, net errors and omissions.


  The concepts and definitions underlying the data are based on the sixth edition of the International
  Monetary Fund''s (IMF) Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). Balance of payments data for 2005 onward will
  be presented in accord with the BPM6. The historical BPM5 data series will end with data for 2008, which
  can be accessed through the World Development Indicators archives.
