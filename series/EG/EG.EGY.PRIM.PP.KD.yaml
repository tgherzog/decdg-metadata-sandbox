description: Energy intensity level of primary energy is the ratio between energy supply and gross domestic
  product measured at purchasing power parity. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is
  used to produce one unit of economic output. Lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce
  one unit of output.

Limitationsandexceptions: Energy intensity level is only an imperfect proxy to energy efficiency indicator
  and it can be affected by a number of factors not necessarily linked to pure efficiency such as climate.
Periodicity: Annual

  Program.
Statisticalconceptandmethodology: This indicator is obtained by dividing total primary energy supply over
  gross domestic product measured in constant 2011 US dollars at purchasing power parity.
