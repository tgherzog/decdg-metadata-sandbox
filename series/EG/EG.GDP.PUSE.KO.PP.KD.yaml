Developmentrelevance: 'In developing economies growth in energy use is closely related to growth in the
  modern sectors - industry, motorized transport, and urban areas - but energy use also reflects climatic,
  geographic, and economic factors (such as the relative price of energy). Energy use has been growing
  rapidly in low- and middle-income economies, but high-income economies still use almost five times as
  much energy on a per capita basis.


  Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are
  being depleted much faster than new ones are being made. In developing economies growth in energy use
  is closely related to growth in the modern sectors - industry, motorized transport, and urban areas
  - but energy use also reflects climatic, geographic, and economic factors (such as the relative price
  of energy). Energy use has been growing rapidly in low- and middle-income economies, but high-income
  economies still use almost five times as much energy on a per capita basis.'

Limitationsandexceptions: The IEA makes these estimates in consultation with national statistical offices,
  oil companies, electric utilities, and national energy experts. The IEA occasionally revises its time
  series to reflect political changes, and energy statistics undergo continual changes in coverage or
  methodology as more detailed energy accounts become available. Breaks in series are therefore unavoidable.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to energy use indicates energy
  efficiency. To produce comparable and consistent estimates of real GDP across economies relative to
  physical inputs to GDP - that is, units of energy use - GDP is converted to 2017 international dollars
  using purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. Differences in this ratio over time and across economies
  reflect structural changes in an economy, changes in sectoral energy efficiency, and differences in
  fuel mixes. Total energy use refers to the use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use
  fuels (such as electricity and refined petroleum products). It includes energy from combustible renewables
  and waste - solid biomass and animal products, gas and liquid from biomass, and industrial and municipal
  waste. Biomass is any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into fuel, heat, or electricity.
  Energy data are compiled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA data for economies that are not
  members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are based on national energy
  data adjusted to conform to annual questionnaires completed by OECD member governments. GDP data are
  from World Bank's national accounts files.
Topic: 'Environment: Energy production & use'
description: GDP per unit of energy use is the PPP GDP per kilogram of oil equivalent of energy use. PPP
  GDP is gross domestic product converted to 2017 constant international dollars using purchasing power
  parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as a U.S. dollar has in
  the United States.
