Developmentrelevance: 'In developing economies growth in energy use is closely related to growth in the
  modern sectors - industry, motorized transport, and urban areas - but energy use also reflects climatic,
  geographic, and economic factors (such as the relative price of energy). Energy use has been growing
  rapidly in low- and middle-income economies, but high-income economies still use almost five times as
  much energy on a per capita basis.


  Governments in many countries are increasingly aware of the urgent need to make better use of the world''s
  energy resources. Improved energy efficiency is often the most economic and readily available means
  of improving energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.'

Limitationsandexceptions: The IEA makes these estimates in consultation with national statistical offices,
  oil companies, electric utilities, and national energy experts. The IEA occasionally revises its time
  series to reflect political changes, and energy statistics undergo continual changes in coverage or
  methodology as more detailed energy accounts become available. Breaks in series are therefore unavoidable.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Total energy use refers to the use of primary energy before transformation
  to other end-use fuels (such as electricity and refined petroleum products). It includes energy from
  combustible renewables and waste - solid biomass and animal products, gas and liquid from biomass, and
  industrial and municipal waste. Biomass is any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into
  fuel, heat, or electricity. World Bank population estimates are used to calculate per capita data.


  Energy data are compiled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA data for economies that are not
  members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are based on national energy
  data adjusted to conform to annual questionnaires completed by OECD member governments.


  Data for combustible renewables and waste are often based on small surveys or other incomplete information
  and thus give only a broad impression of developments and are not strictly comparable across countries.
  The IEA reports include country notes that explain some of these differences. All forms of energy -
  primary energy and primary electricity - are converted into oil equivalents. A notional thermal efficiency
  of 33 percent is assumed for converting nuclear electricity into oil equivalents and 100 percent efficiency
  for converting hydroelectric power.'
Topic: 'Environment: Energy production & use'
description: Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels,
  which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied
  to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport.
