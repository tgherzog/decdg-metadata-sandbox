description: Net energy imports are estimated as energy use less production, both measured in oil equivalents.
  A negative value indicates that the country is a net exporter. Energy use refers to use of primary energy
  before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and
  stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Modern energy services are crucial to a country''s economic development. Access
  to modern energy is essential for the provision of clean water, sanitation and healthcare and for the
  provision of reliable and efficient lighting, heating, cooking, mechanical power, and transport and
  telecommunications services.


  Governments in many countries are increasingly aware of the urgent need to make better use of the world''s
  energy resources. Improved energy efficiency is often the most economic and readily available means
  of improving energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.'

Limitationsandexceptions: The IEA makes these estimates in consultation with national statistical offices,
  oil companies, electric utilities, and national energy experts. The IEA occasionally revises its time
  series to reflect political changes, and energy statistics undergo continual changes in coverage or
  methodology as more detailed energy accounts become available. Breaks in series are therefore unavoidable.
Periodicity: Annual

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Energy data are compiled by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
  IEA data for economies that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
  (OECD) are based on national energy data adjusted to conform to annual questionnaires completed by OECD
  member governments.


  A negative value in energy imports indicates that the country is a net exporter. Energy use refers to
  use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production
  plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international
  transport.'
