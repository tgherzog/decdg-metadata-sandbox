Developmentrelevance: 'Alternative energy is produced without the undesirable consequences of the burning
  of fossil fuels, such as high carbon dioxide emissions, which is considered to be the major contributing
  factor of global warming.


  Past few decade have seen a rise in global investment in renewable energy, led by wind and solar. In
  transport, major car companies are adding hybrid and full-electric vehicles to their product lines and
  many governments have launched plans to encourage consumers to buy these vehicles Fossil fuels continue
  to outpace alternative and renewable energy growth. Coal has been the fastest-growing global energy
  source, meeting about one-half of new electricity demand.


  Total energy use refers to the use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels (such
  as electricity and refined petroleum products). It includes energy from combustible renewables and waste
  - solid biomass and animal products, gas and liquid from biomass, and industrial and municipal waste.
  Biomass is any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into fuel, heat, or electricity.


  Governments in many countries are increasingly aware of the urgent need to make better use of the world''s
  energy resources. Improved energy efficiency is often the most economic and readily available means
  of improving energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.'

Limitationsandexceptions: The IEA makes these estimates in consultation with national statistical offices,
  oil companies, electric utilities, and national energy experts. The IEA occasionally revises its time
  series to reflect political changes, and energy statistics undergo continual changes in coverage or
  methodology as more detailed energy accounts become available. Breaks in series are therefore unavoidable.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Energy data are compiled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA
  data for economies that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
  (OECD) are based on national energy data adjusted to conform to annual questionnaires completed by OECD
  member governments.

description: Clean energy is noncarbohydrate energy that does not produce carbon dioxide when generated.
  It includes hydropower and nuclear, geothermal, and solar power, among others.
