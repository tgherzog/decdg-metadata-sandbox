Developmentrelevance: 'Maintaining reliable and secure electricity services while seeking to rapidly decarbonize
  power systems is a key challenge for countries throughout the world. More and more countries are becoming
  increasing dependent on reliable and secure electricity supplies to underpin economic growth and community
  prosperity. This reliance is set to grow as more efficient and less carbon intensive forms of power
  are developed and deployed to help decarbonize economies.


  Energy is necessary for creating the conditions for economic growth. It is impossible to operate a factory,
  run a shop, grow crops or deliver goods to consumers without using some form of energy. Access to electricity
  is particularly crucial to human development as electricity is, in practice, indispensable for certain
  basic activities, such as lighting, refrigeration and the running of household appliances, and cannot
  easily be replaced by other forms of energy. Individuals'' access to electricity is one of the most
  clear and un-distorted indication of a country''s energy poverty status.


  Electricity access is increasingly at the forefront of governments'' preoccupations, especially in the
  developing countries. As a consequence, a lot of rural electrification programs and national electrification
  agencies have been created in these countries to monitor more accurately the needs and the status of
  rural development and electrification.


  Use of energy is important in improving people''s standard of living. But electricity generation also
  can damage the environment. Whether such damage occurs depends largely on how electricity is generated.
  For example, burning coal releases twice as much carbon dioxide - a major contributor to global warming
  - as does burning an equivalent amount of natural gas.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources:
  mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used.
  Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys
  (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed
  and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).
  Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps
  in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates,
  a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000,
  and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42
  countries with zero data point and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for electrification
  in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between one and three data points and missing data are
  estimated by using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation
  if data is available for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification
  rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as "Estimate"). Notation "Assumption"
  refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations.
  Data begins from the year in which the first survey data is available for each country.'
