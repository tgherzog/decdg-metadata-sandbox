Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The World Bank uses Atlas method GNI per capita in U.S. dollars to classify
  countries for analytical purposes and to determine borrowing eligibility. For more information, see
  the metadata for Atlas method GNI in current U.S. dollars (NY.GNP.ATLS.CD) and total population (SP.POP.TOTL).
Topic: 'Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Atlas GNI & GNI per capita'
description: GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S.
  dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the sum of value
  added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation
  of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad.
  GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates
  for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate
  is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international
  transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion
  is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given
  year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country,
  and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
  From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
