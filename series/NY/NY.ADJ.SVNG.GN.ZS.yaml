Developmentrelevance: "How wealth changes over time is critical to understanding a country\u2019s prospects\
  \ for sustainable development. Adjusted Net Saving (ANS) was developed as an indicator to approximate\
  \ the change in wealth\u2014based on simple economic theory in which savings equals investment, and\
  \ investment equals the change in wealth.  ANS measures gross national savings, adjusted for gains (spending\
  \ on education) and losses (consumption of fixed capital, depletion of subsoil assets and forests, pollution\
  \ damages).  When ANS is negative, it may indicate that wealth is being run down; when ANS is positive,\
  \ it may indicate that wealth is growing."

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The exercise treats public education expenditures as an addition to savings.
  However, because of the wide variability in the effectiveness of public education expenditures, these
  figures cannot be construed as the value of investments in human capital. A current expenditure of $1
  on education does not necessarily yield $1 of human capital. The calculation should also consider private
  education expenditure, but data are not available for a large number of countries.


  While extensive, the accounting of natural resource depletion and pollution costs still has some gaps.
  Key estimates missing on the resource side include the value of fossil water extracted from aquifers,
  net depletion of fish stocks, and depletion and degradation of soils. Important pollutants affecting
  human health and economic assets are also excluded.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Adjusted net savings are derived from standard national accounting
  measures of gross savings by making four adjustments. First, estimates of fixed capital consumption
  of produced assets are deducted to obtain net savings. Second, current public expenditures on education
  are added to net savings (in standard national accounting these expenditures are treated as consumption).
  Third, estimates of the depletion of a variety of natural resources are deducted to reflect the decline
  in asset values associated with their extraction and harvest. And fourth, deductions are made for damages
  from carbon dioxide emissions and local pollution.


  Estimates of resource depletion are based on the "change in real wealth" method described in Hamilton
  and Ruta (2008), which estimates depletion as the ratio between the total value of the resource and
  the remaining reserve lifetime. The total value of the resource is the present value of current and
  future rents from resource extractions. An economic rent represents an excess return to a given factor
  of production. Natural resources give rise to rents because they are not produced; in contrast, for
  produced goods and services competitive forces will expand supply until economic profits are driven
  to zero. For each type of resource and each country, unit resource rents are derived by taking the difference
  between prices and the average unit extraction or harvest costs. Unit rents are then multiplied by the
  physical quantity extracted or harvested to arrive at total rent. To estimate the value of the resource,
  rents are assumed to be constant over the life of the resource (the El Serafy approach), and the present
  value of the rent flow is calculated using a 4 percent discount rate.'
