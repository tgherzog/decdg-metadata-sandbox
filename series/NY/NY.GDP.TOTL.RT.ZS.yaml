Developmentrelevance: 'Accounting for the contribution of natural resources to economic output is important
  in building an analytical framework for sustainable development. In some countries earnings from natural
  resources, especially from fossil fuels and minerals, account for a sizable share of GDP, and much of
  these earnings come in the form of economic rents - revenues above the cost of extracting the resources.


  Natural resources give rise to economic rents because they are not produced. For produced goods and
  services competitive forces expand supply until economic profits are driven to zero, but natural resources
  in fixed supply often command returns well in excess of their cost of production. Rents from nonrenewable
  resources - fossil fuels and minerals - as well as rents from overharvesting of forests indicate the
  liquidation of a country''s capital stock. When countries use such rents to support current consumption
  rather than to invest in new capital to replace what is being used up, they are, in effect, borrowing
  against their future.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The estimates of natural resources rents are calculated as the difference
  between the price of a commodity and the average cost of producing it. This is done by estimating the
  price of units of specific commodities and subtracting estimates of average unit costs of extraction
  or harvesting costs. These unit rents are then multiplied by the physical quantities countries extract
  or harvest to determine the rents for each commodity as a share of gross domestic product (GDP).
