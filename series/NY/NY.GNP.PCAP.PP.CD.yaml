description: 'This indicator provides per capita values for gross national income (GNI. Formerly GNP)
  expressed in current international dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor.
  

  GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not
  included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and
  property income) from abroad. PPP conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter
  that eliminates the effects of the differences in price levels between countries.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Typically, higher income countries have higher price levels, while
   lower income countries have lower price levels (Balassa-Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based
   cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components reflect both differences in economic
   outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences in price levels, the size of higher income countries
   is inflated, while the size of lower income countries is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country
   comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume),
   as PPPs control for price level differences between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects the
   real size of the countries.\n\nFor more information on underlying GNI in current international dollar,
