Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Typically, higher income countries have higher price levels, while\
  \ lower income countries have lower price levels (Balassa-Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based\
  \ cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components reflect both differences in economic\
  \ outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences in price levels, the size of higher income countries\
  \ is inflated, while the size of lower income countries is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country\
  \ comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume),\
  \ as PPPs control for price level differences between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects\
  \ the real size of the countries.\n\nFor more information on underlying GDP in current international\
  \ dollar, please refer to the metadata for \"GDP, PPP (current international $)\" [NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD].\n\
  For more information on underlying population, please refer to the metadata for \"total population\u201D\
  \ [SP.POP.TOTL]. \nFor the concept and methodology of PPP, please refer to the International Comparison\
  \ Program (ICP)\u2019s website (https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp)."
Topic: 'Economic Policy & Debt: Purchasing power parity'
description: "This indicator provides per capita values for gross domestic product (GDP) expressed in\
  \ current international dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor. \n\nGDP\
  \ is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the country plus any product taxes and\
  \ minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. conversion factor is a spatial price\
  \ deflator and currency converter that controls for price level differences between countries. Total\
  \ population is a mid-year population based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all\
  \ residents regardless of legal status or citizenship."
