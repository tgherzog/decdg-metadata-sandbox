description: GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the
  economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It
  is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation
  of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic
  currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange
  rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative
  conversion factor is used.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Gross domestic product (GDP), though widely tracked, may not always be the
  most relevant summary of aggregated economic performance for all economies, especially when production
  occurs at the expense of consuming capital stock.


  While GDP estimates based on the production approach are generally more reliable than estimates compiled
  from the income or expenditure side, different countries use different definitions, methods, and reporting
  standards. World Bank staff review the quality of national accounts data and sometimes make adjustments
  to improve consistency with international guidelines. Nevertheless, significant discrepancies remain
  between international standards and actual practice. Many statistical offices, especially those in developing
  countries, face severe limitations in the resources, time, training, and budgets required to produce
  reliable and comprehensive series of national accounts statistics.


  Among the difficulties faced by compilers of national accounts is the extent of unreported economic
  activity in the informal or secondary economy. In developing countries a large share of agricultural
  output is either not exchanged (because it is consumed within the household) or not exchanged for money.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the sum of value added by all
  its producers. Value added is the value of the gross output of producers less the value of intermediate
  goods and services consumed in production, before accounting for consumption of fixed capital in production.
  The United Nations System of National Accounts calls for value added to be valued at either basic prices
  (excluding net taxes on products) or producer prices (including net taxes on products paid by producers
  but excluding sales or value added taxes). Both valuations exclude transport charges that are invoiced
  separately by producers. Total GDP is measured at purchaser prices. Value added by industry is normally
  measured at basic prices.
