Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: The gross intake ratio in the first grade of primary education indicates the level
  of access to primary education and the education system's capacity to provide access to primary education.
  A low gross intake ratio in the first grade of primary education reflects the fact that many children
  do not enter primary education even though school attendance, at least through the primary level, is
  mandatory in most countries. Because the gross intake ratio includes all new entrants regardless of
  age, it can exceed 100 percent in some situations, such as immediately after fees have been abolished
  or when the number of reenrolled children is large.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

Limitationsandexceptions: The quality of data is affected when new entrants and repeaters are not correctly
  distinguished in the first grade of primary education. Caution is also needed for countries with a total
  population under 100,000 since the United Nations Population Division neither publish nor endorse single-age
  data for those countries. The data are highly subject to fluctuations in migration and other factors.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Gross intake ratio in the first grade of primary education is calculated
  by dividing the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the first grade of primary education,
  regardless of age, by the population of the official primary entrance age and multiplying the result
  by 100.


  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its
  annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version
  was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United Nations
  Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations,
  and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential
  enumeration problems in national censuses.


  The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the
  school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases
  the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).'
