description: Primary completion rate, or gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education, is
  the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary education, regardless
  of age, divided by the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education. Data
  limitations preclude adjusting for students who drop out during the final year of primary education.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: The World Bank and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics jointly developed the primary
  completion rate indicator. Increasingly used as a core indicator of an education system's performance,
  it reflects an education system's coverage and the educational attainment of students.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

  Data limitations preclude adjusting for students who drop out during the final year of primary education.
  Thus this rate is a proxy that should be taken as an upper estimate of the actual primary completion
  rate.
   
  There are many reasons why the primary completion rate can exceed 100 percent. The numerator may include
  late entrants and overage children who have repeated one or more grades of primary education as well
  as children who entered school early, while the denominator is the number of children at the entrance
  age for the last grade of primary education.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Primary completion rate is calculated by dividing the number of new
  entrants (enrollment minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary education, regardless of age, by
  the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education and multiplying by 100. 


  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its
  annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version
  was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United Nations
  Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations,
  and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential
  enumeration problems in national censuses.


  The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the
  school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases
  the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).'
