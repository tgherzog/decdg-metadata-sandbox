Developmentrelevance: 'Literacy rate is an outcome indicator to evaluate educational attainment. This
  data can predict the quality of future labor force and can be used in ensuring policies for life skills
  for men and women.


  It can be also used as a proxy instrument to see the effectiveness of education system; a high literacy
  rate suggests the capacity of an education system to provide a large population with opportunities to
  acquire literacy skills. The accumulated achievement of education is fundamental for further intellectual
  growth and social and economic development, although it doesn''t necessarily ensure the quality of education.


  Literate women implies that they can seek and use information for the betterment of the health, nutrition
  and education of their household members. Literate women are also empowered to play a meaningful role.'

Limitationsandexceptions: In practice, literacy is difficult to measure. Estimating literacy rates requires
  census or survey measurements under controlled conditions. Many countries report the number of literate
  people from self-reported data. Some use educational attainment data as a proxy but apply different
  lengths of school attendance or levels of completion. Ant there is a trend among recent national and
  international surveys toward using a direct reading test of literacy skills. Because definitions and
  methods of data collection differ across countries, data should be used cautiously.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Literacy statistics for most countries cover the population ages 15
  and older, but some include younger ages or are confined to age ranges that tend to inflate literacy
  rates. The youth literacy rate for ages 15-24 reflects recent progress in education. It measures the
  accumulated outcomes of primary education over the previous 10 years or so by indicating the proportion
  of the population who have passed through the primary education system and acquired basic literacy and
  numeracy skills. Generally, literacy also encompasses numeracy, the ability to make simple arithmetic
  calculations.


  Data on literacy are compiled by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics based on national censuses and
  household surveys and, for countries without recent literacy data, using the Global Age-Specific Literacy
  Projection Model (GALP). For detailed information, see www.uis.unesco.org.'
