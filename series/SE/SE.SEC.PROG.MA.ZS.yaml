description: Progression to secondary school refers to the number of new entrants to the first grade of
  secondary school in a given year as a percentage of the number of students enrolled in the final grade
  of primary school in the previous year (minus the number of repeaters from the last grade of primary
  education in the given year).
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: The effective transition rate from primary to secondary education conveys the degree
  of access or transition between the two levels. As completing primary education is a prerequisite for
  participating in lower secondary education, growing numbers of primary completers will inevitably create
  pressure for more available places at the secondary level. A low effective transition rate can signal
  such problems as an inadequate examination and promotion system or insufficient secondary education
  capacity.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

Limitationsandexceptions: The quality of data on the transition rate is affected when new entrants and
  repeaters are not correctly distinguished. Students who interrupt their studies after completing primary
  education could also affect data quality.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Effective transition rate is calculated by dividing the number of new
  entrants in the first grade of secondary education in a given year (t) by the number of students who
  enrolled in the final grade of primary education in the previous school year (t-1) minus the number
  of repeaters from the last grade of primary education in the given year (t), and multiplying by 100.
  

  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its
  annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version
  was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. 


  The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the
  school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases
  the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).'
