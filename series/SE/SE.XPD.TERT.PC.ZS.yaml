Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'General government expenditure per student in tertiary education is
  calculated by dividing total government expenditure on tertiary education by the number of students
  at tertiary level, expressed as a percentage of GDP per capita. Aggregate data are World Bank estimates.


  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its
  annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version
  was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Data on GDP per capita come from the World Bank.
  


  The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the
  school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases
  the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).'
