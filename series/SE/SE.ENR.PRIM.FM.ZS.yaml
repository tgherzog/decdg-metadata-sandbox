description: Gender parity index for gross enrollment ratio in primary education is the ratio of girls
  to boys enrolled at primary level in public and private schools.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: The Gender Parity Index (GPI) indicates parity between girls and boys. A GPI of
  less than 1 suggests girls are more disadvantaged than boys in learning opportunities and a GPI of greater
  than 1 suggests the other way around. Eliminating gender disparities in education would help increase
  the status and capabilities of women.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'This indicator is calculated by dividing female gross enrollment ratio
  in primary education by male gross enrollment ratio in primary education. 


  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its
  annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version
  was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. 


  The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the
  school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases
  the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).'
