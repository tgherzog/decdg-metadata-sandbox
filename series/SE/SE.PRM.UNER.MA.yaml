description: Children out of school are the number of primary-school-age children not enrolled in primary
  or secondary school.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: Large numbers of children out of school create pressure to enroll children and provide
  classrooms, teachers, and educational materials, a task made difficult in many countries by limited
  education budgets. However, getting children into school is a high priority for countries and crucial
  for achieving universal primary education.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The number of out-of-school children is calculated by subtracting the
  number of primary school-age children enrolled in primary or secondary school from the total population
  of the official primary school-age children. 


  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its
  annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version
  was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United Nations
  Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations,
  and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential
  enumeration problems in national censuses.


  The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the
  school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases
  the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).'
