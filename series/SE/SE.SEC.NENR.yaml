Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Gross enrollment ratios indicate the capacity of each level of the education system,
  but a high ratio may reflect a substantial number of overage children enrolled in each grade because
  of repetition or late entry rather than a successful education system. The net enrollment rate excludes
  overage and underage students and more accurately captures the system's coverage and internal efficiency.
  Differences between the gross enrollment ratio and the net enrollment rate show the incidence of overage
  and underage enrollments.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

Limitationsandexceptions: Enrollment indicators are based on annual school surveys, but do not necessarily
  reflect actual attendance or dropout rates during the year. Also, the length of education differs across
  countries and can influence enrollment rates, although the International Standard Classification of
  Education (ISCED) tries to minimize the difference. For example, a shorter duration for primary education
  tends to increase the rate; a longer one to decrease it (in part because older children are more at
  risk of dropping out). Moreover, age at enrollment may be inaccurately estimated or misstated, especially
  in communities where registration of births is not strictly enforced.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Net enrollment rate for secondary school is calculated by dividing\
  \ the number of students of official school age enrolled in secondary education by the population of\
  \ the age group which officially corresponds to secondary education, and multiplying by 100. \n\nData\
  \ on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual\
  \ education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education\
  \ (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current\
  \ version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United\
  \ Nations Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations,\
  \ and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential\
  \ enumeration problems in national censuses.\n\nThe reference years reflect the school year for which\
  \ the data are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar years (for example, from\
  \ September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to the year in which the school\
  \ year ended (2011 in the example)."
Topic: 'Education: Participation'
description: Net enrollment rate is the ratio of children of official school age who are enrolled in school
  to the population of the corresponding official school age. Secondary education completes the provision
  of basic education that began at the primary level, and aims at laying the foundations for lifelong
  learning and human development, by offering more subject- or skill-oriented instruction using more specialized
  teachers.
