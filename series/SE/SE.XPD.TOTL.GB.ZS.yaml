Developmentrelevance: The share of government expenditure devoted to education allows an assessment of
  the priority a government assigns to education relative to other public investments, as well as a government's
  commitment to investing in human capital development. Countries with younger populations may spend more
  on education in relation to other sector such as health or social security, and vice-versa.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Expenditure on education, total (% of government expenditure) is calculated\
  \ by dividing total government expenditure on education by the total government expenditure on all sectors\
  \ and multiplying by 100. Aggregate data are based on World Bank estimates.\n\nData on education are\
  \ collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey.\
  \ All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure\
  \ the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally\
  \ adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Data on total general government expenditure were previously\
  \ collected from countries through the annual questionnaire, but are from the International Monetary\
  \ Fund's World Economic Outlook database since January 2014. Therefore, current data cannot be compared\
  \ with data in earlier editions. \n\nThe reference years reflect the school year for which the data\
  \ are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September\
  \ 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to the year in which the school year\
  \ ended (2011 in the example)."
