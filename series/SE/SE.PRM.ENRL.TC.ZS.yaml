Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: The pupil-teacher ratio is often used to compare the quality of schooling across
  countries, but it is often weakly related to student learning and quality of education.
Generalcomments: For aggregate data, each economy is classified based on the classification of World Bank
  Group's fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).

Limitationsandexceptions: The comparability of pupil-teacher ratios across countries is affected by the
  definition of teachers and by differences in class size by grade and in the number of hours taught,
  as well as the different practices countries employ such as part-time teachers, school shifts, and multi-grade
  classes. Moreover, the underlying enrollment levels are subject to a variety of reporting errors.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Pupil-teacher ratio is calculated by dividing the number of students\
  \ at the specified level of education by the number of teachers at the same level of education. \n\n\
  Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its\
  \ annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education\
  \ (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current\
  \ version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. \n\nThe reference years reflect the\
  \ school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar\
  \ years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to\
  \ the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example)."
