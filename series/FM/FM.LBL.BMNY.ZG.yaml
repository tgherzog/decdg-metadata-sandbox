Limitationsandexceptions: Monetary accounts are derived from the balance sheets of financial institutions
  - the central bank, commercial banks, and nonbank financial intermediaries. Although these balance sheets
  are usually reliable, they are subject to errors of classification, valuation, and timing and to differences
  in accounting practices. For example, whether interest income is recorded on an accrual or a cash basis
  can make a substantial difference, as can the treatment of nonperforming assets. Valuation errors typically
  arise for foreign exchange transactions, particularly in countries with flexible exchange rates or in
  countries that have undergone currency devaluation during the reporting period. The valuation of financial
  derivatives and the net liabilities of the banking system can also be difficult. The quality of commercial
  bank reporting also may be adversely affected by delays in reports from bank branches, especially in
  countries where branch accounts are not computerized. Thus the data in the balance sheets of commercial
  banks may be based on preliminary estimates subject to constant revision. This problem is likely to
  be even more serious for nonbank financial intermediaries.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Money and the financial accounts that record the supply of money lie\
  \ at the heart of a country\u2019s financial system. There are several commonly used definitions of\
  \ the money supply. The narrowest, M1, encompasses currency held by the public and demand deposits with\
  \ banks. M2 includes M1 plus time and savings deposits with banks that require prior notice for withdrawal.\
  \ M3 includes M2 as well as various money market instruments, such as certificates of deposit issued\
  \ by banks, bank deposits denominated in foreign currency, and deposits with financial institutions\
  \ other than banks. However defined, money is a liability of the banking system, distinguished from\
  \ other bank liabilities by the special role it plays as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and\
  \ a store of value."
