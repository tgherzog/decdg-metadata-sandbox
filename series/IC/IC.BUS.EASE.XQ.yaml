description: Ease of doing business ranks economies from 1 to 190, with first place being the best. The
  ranking of economies is determined by sorting the aggregate ease of doing business scores. A high ranking
  (a low numerical rank) means that the regulatory environment is conducive to business operation.
Developmentrelevance: 'The economic health of a country is measured not only in macroeconomic terms but
  also by other factors that shape daily economic activity such as laws, regulations, and institutional
  arrangements. The fundamental premise of this data is that economic activity requires good rules and
  regulations that are efficient, accessible to all who need to use them, and simple to implement. 

  The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement
  across 190 economies and selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

  The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and
  measures the regulations applying to them through their life cycle.

  By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments
  across economies and over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more efficient
  regulation; offers measurable benchmarks for reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists,
  private sector researchers and others interested in the business climate of each economy.'
Generalcomments: Data are presented for the survey year instead of publication year. The country ranking
  is only available for the latest year.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The Doing Business methodology has limitations that should be considered when
  interpreting the data. First, the data collected refer to businesses in the economy''s largest city
  and may not represent regulations in other locations of the economy. To address this limitation, subnational
  indicators are being collected for selected economies. These subnational studies point to significant
  differences in the speed of reform and the ease of doing business across cities in the same economy.
  Second, the data often focus on a specific business form - generally a limited liability company of
  a specified size - and may not represent regulation for other types of businesses such as sole proprietorships.
  Third, transactions described in a standardized business case refer to a specific set of issues and
  may not represent the full set of issues a business encounters. Fourth, the time measures involve an
  element of judgment by the expert respondents. When sources indicate different estimates, the Doing
  Business time indicators represent the median values of several responses given under the assumptions
  of the standardized case. Fifth, the methodology assumes that a business has full information on what
  is required and does not waste time when completing procedures. Please also see: https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/about-us/faq'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The ranking of economies is determined by sorting the aggregate ease
  of doing business scores. The aggregate ease of doing business score for each economy is the simple
  average of their scores on each of the 10 topics included in the ranking: starting a business, dealing
  with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority
  investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency. All topics
  are weighted equally. 


  Data are collected by the World Bank with a standardized survey that uses a simple business case to
  ensure comparability across economies and over time - with assumptions about the legal form of the business,
  its size, its location, and nature of its operation. Surveys are administered through more than 9,000
  local experts, including lawyers, business consultants, accountants, freight forwarders, government
  officials, and other professionals who routinely administer or advise on legal and regulatory requirements.


  The Doing Business project of the World Bank encompasses two types of data: data from readings of laws
  and regulations and data on time and motion indicators that measure efficiency in achieving a regulatory
  goal. Within the time and motion indicators cost estimates are recorded from official fee schedules
  where applicable. The data from surveys are subjected to numerous tests for robustness, which lead to
  revision or expansion of the information collected. Please also refer to the Doing Business website
