Developmentrelevance: 'Access to finance can expand opportunities for all with higher levels of access
  and use of banking services associated with lower financing obstacles for people and businesses. A stable
  financial system that promotes efficient savings and investment is also crucial for a thriving democracy
  and market economy.


  There are several aspects of access to financial services: availability, cost, and quality of services.
  The development and growth of credit markets depend on access to timely, reliable, and accurate data
  on borrowers'' credit experiences. Access to credit can be improved by making it easy to create and
  enforce collateral agreements and by increasing information about potential borrowers'' creditworthiness.
  Lenders look at a borrower''s credit history and collateral. Where credit registries and effective collateral
  laws are absent - as in many developing countries - banks make fewer loans. Indicators that cover getting
  credit include the strength of legal rights index and the depth of credit information index.


  The economic health of a country is measured not only in macroeconomic terms but also by other factors
  that shape daily economic activity such as laws, regulations, and institutional arrangements. The data
  measure business regulation, gauge regulatory outcomes, and measure the extent of legal protection of
  property, the flexibility of employment regulation, and the tax burden on businesses.


  The fundamental premise of this data is that economic activity requires good rules and regulations that
  are efficient, accessible to all who need to use them, and simple to implement. Thus sometimes there
  is more emphasis on more regulation, such as stricter disclosure requirements in related-party transactions,
  and other times emphasis is on for simplified regulations, such as a one-stop shop for completing business
  startup formalities.


  Entrepreneurs may not be aware of all required procedures or may avoid legally required procedures altogether.
  But where regulation is particularly onerous, levels of informality are higher, which comes at a cost:
  firms in the informal sector usually grow more slowly, have less access to credit, and employ fewer
  workers - and those workers remain outside the protections of labor law. The indicator can help policymakers
  understand the business environment in a country and - along with information from other sources such
  as the World Bank''s Enterprise Surveys - provide insights into potential areas of reform.'
Generalcomments: Data are presented for the survey year instead of publication year. Data before 2013
  are not comparable with data from 2013 onward due to methodological changes.

Limitationsandexceptions: The Doing Business methodology has limitations that should be considered when
  interpreting the data. First, the data collected refer to businesses in the economy's largest city and
  may not represent regulations in other locations of the economy. To address this limitation, subnational
  indicators are being collected for selected economies. These subnational studies point to significant
  differences in the speed of reform and the ease of doing business across cities in the same economy.
  Second, the data often focus on a specific business form - generally a limited liability company of
  a specified size - and may not represent regulation for other types of businesses such as sole proprietorships.
  Third, transactions described in a standardized business case refer to a specific set of issues and
  may not represent the full set of issues a business encounters. Fourth, the time measures involve an
  element of judgment by the expert respondents. When sources indicate different estimates, the Doing
  Business time indicators represent the median values of several responses given under the assumptions
  of the standardized case. Fifth, the methodology assumes that a business has full information on what
  is required and does not waste time when completing procedures.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'For Doing Business 2015, the credit information index has expanded
  with two new measurements, namely whether (1) banks and financial institutions access credit bureaus
  and credit registries'' databases through an online platform or system-to-system connection; and (2)
  bureau or registry credit scores are offered as a value added service to help banks and financial institutions
  to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. Furthermore, if the credit bureau or registry is not operational
  or covers less than 5% of the adult population, the score on the depth of credit information index is
  0. (Previously, the coverage threshold to score on the credit information index was 0.1%. In Doing Business
  2015 this threshold has been increased to 5%.)


  Data are collected by the World Bank with a standardized survey that uses a simple business case to
  ensure comparability across economies and over time - with assumptions about the legal form of the business,
  its size, its location, and nature of its operation. Surveys are administered through more than 9,000
  local experts, including lawyers, business consultants, accountants, freight forwarders, government
  officials, and other professionals who routinely administer or advise on legal and regulatory requirements.


  The Doing Business project of the World Bank encompasses two types of data: data from readings of laws
  and regulations and data on time and motion indicators that measure efficiency in achieving a regulatory
  goal. Within the time and motion indicators cost estimates are recorded from official fee schedules
  where applicable. The data from surveys are subjected to numerous tests for robustness, which lead to
  revision or expansion of the information collected. For more information on methodology, see http://www.doingbusiness.org/Methodology/getting-credit#legalRights.'

description: Depth of credit information index measures rules affecting the scope, accessibility, and
  quality of credit information available through public or private credit registries. The index ranges
  from 0 to 8, with higher values indicating the availability of more credit information, from either
  a public registry or a private bureau, to facilitate lending decisions.
