description: Time required to start a business is the number of calendar days needed to complete the procedures
  to legally operate a business. If a procedure can be speeded up at additional cost, the fastest procedure,
  independent of cost, is chosen.
Aggregationmethod: Unweighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'The economic health of a country is measured not only in macroeconomic terms but
  also by other factors that shape daily economic activity such as laws, regulations, and institutional
  arrangements. The data measure business regulation, gauge regulatory outcomes, and measure the extent
  of legal protection of property, the flexibility of employment regulation, and the tax burden on businesses.


  The fundamental premise of this data is that economic activity requires good rules and regulations that
  are efficient, accessible to all who need to use them, and simple to implement. Thus sometimes there
  is more emphasis on more regulation, such as stricter disclosure requirements in related-party transactions,
  and other times emphasis is on for simplified regulations, such as a one-stop shop for completing business
  startup formalities.


  Entrepreneurs may not be aware of all required procedures or may avoid legally required procedures altogether.
  But where regulation is particularly onerous, levels of informality are higher, which comes at a cost:
  firms in the informal sector usually grow more slowly, have less access to credit, and employ fewer
  workers - and those workers remain outside the protections of labor law. The indicator can help policymakers
  understand the business environment in a country and - along with information from other sources such
  as the World Bank''s Enterprise Surveys - provide insights into potential areas of reform.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The Doing Business methodology has limitations that should be considered when
  interpreting the data. First, the data collected refer to businesses in the economy''s largest city
  and may not represent regulations in other locations of the economy. To address this limitation, subnational
  indicators are being collected for selected economies. These subnational studies point to significant
  differences in the speed of reform and the ease of doing business across cities in the same economy.
  Second, the data often focus on a specific business form - generally a limited liability company of
  a specified size - and may not represent regulation for other types of businesses such as sole proprietorships.
  Third, transactions described in a standardized business case refer to a specific set of issues and
  may not represent the full set of issues a business encounters. Fourth, the time measures involve an
  element of judgment by the expert respondents. When sources indicate different estimates, the Doing
  Business time indicators represent the median values of several responses given under the assumptions
  of the standardized case. Fifth, the methodology assumes that a business has full information on what
  is required and does not waste time when completing procedures. Please also see: https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/about-us/faq'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Data are collected by the World Bank with a standardized survey that
   uses a simple business case to ensure comparability across economies and over time - with assumptions
   about the legal form of the business, its size, its location, and nature of its operation. Surveys
   are administered through more than 9,000 local experts, including lawyers, business consultants, accountants,
   freight forwarders, government officials, and other professionals who routinely administer or advise
   on legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nEntrepreneurs around the world face a range of challenges.
   One of them is inefficient regulation. This indicator measures the time for a small- to medium-size
   limited liability company to start up and formally operate in each economy\u2019s largest business
   city.  To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business
   that is 100% domestically owned, has a start-up capital equivalent to 10 times the income per capita,
   engages in general industrial or commercial activities and employs between 10 and 50 people one month
   after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals.  The starting a business
   indicators consider two cases of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects,
   except that one company is owned by five married women and the other by five married men.  \n\nThe
   Doing Business project of the World Bank encompasses two types of data: data from readings of laws
   and regulations and data on time and motion indicators that measure efficiency in achieving a regulatory
   goal. Within the time and motion indicators cost estimates are recorded from official fee schedules
   where applicable. The data from surveys are subjected to numerous tests for robustness, which lead
   to revision or expansion of the information collected."
