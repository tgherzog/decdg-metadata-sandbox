Developmentrelevance: 'Entrepreneurship is a critical part of economic development and growth and important
  for the continued dynamism of the modern economy. To measure entrepreneurial activity, annual data is
  collected directly from 139 company registrars on the number of newly registered firms over the past
  seven years. The data shows the trends in new firm creation across regions, the relationship between
  entrepreneurship and the business environment and financial development, and the financial crisis''
  effect on the entrepreneurial activity in the formal sector.


  Private sector development and investment - tapping private sector initiative and investment for socially
  useful purposes - are critical for poverty reduction. In parallel with public sector efforts, private
  investment, especially in competitive markets, has tremendous potential to contribute to growth. Private
  markets are the engine of productivity growth, creating productive jobs and higher incomes. And with
  government playing a complementary role of regulation, funding, and service provision, private initiative
  and investment can help provide the basic services and conditions that empower poor people - by improving
  health, education, and infrastructure.'
Generalcomments: For cross-country comparability, only limited liability corporations that operate in
  the formal sector are included.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The definition of entrepreneurship used is limited to the formal sector. Yet,
  it should be noted that the exclusion of the informal sector is based on the difficulties of quantifying
  the number of firms that compose it, rather than on its relevance for developing economies. The Entrepreneurship
  Database facilitates the analysis of the growth of the formal private sector and the identification
  of factors that encourage firms to begin operations in or transition to the formal sector. Data is collected
  all limited liability corporations regardless of size. Partnerships and sole proprietorships are not
  considered in the analysis due to the differences with respect to their definition and regulation worldwide.
  Data on the number of total or closed firms are not included due to heterogeneity in how these entities
  are defined and measured.


  The Entrepreneurship Database is a critical source of data that facilitates the measurement of entrepreneurial
  activity across countries and over time. The data also allows for a deeper understanding of the relationship
  between new firm registration, the regulatory environment, and economic growth. Previous research using
  the Entrepreneurship Database has shown a significant relationship between the level of cost, time,
  and procedures required to start a business and new firm registration.


  To facilitate cross-country comparability, the Entrepreneurship Database employs a consistent unit of
  measurement, source of information, and concept of entrepreneurship that is applicable and available
  among the diverse sample of participating economies.'

  The data collection process involves telephone interviews and email correspondence with business registries
  in 139 economies. The main sources of information for this study are national business registries. In
  a limited number of cases where the business registry was unable to provide the data - most often due
  to an absence of digitized registration systems - the Entrepreneurship Database uses other alternatives
  sources, such as statistical agencies, tax and labor agencies, chambers of commerce, and private vendors
  or publicly available data.


  The units of measurement are private, formal sector companies with limited liability.'
