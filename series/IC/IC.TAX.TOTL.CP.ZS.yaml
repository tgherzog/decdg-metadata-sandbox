Developmentrelevance: 'The total tax rate payable by businesses provides a comprehensive measure of the
  cost of all the taxes a business bears. It differs from the statutory tax rate, which is the factor
  applied to the tax base. In computing business tax rates, actual tax payable is divided by commercial
  profit.


  Taxes are the main source of revenue for most governments. The sources of tax revenue and their relative
  contributions are determined by government policy choices about where and how to impose taxes and by
  changes in the structure of the economy. Tax policy may reflect concerns about distributional effects,
  economic efficiency (including corrections for externalities), and the practical problems of administering
  a tax system. There is no ideal level of taxation. But taxes influence incentives and thus the behavior
  of economic actors and the economy''s competitiveness.'

Limitationsandexceptions: "To make the data comparable across countries, several assumptions are made\
  \ about businesses. The main assumptions are that they are limited liability companies, they operate\
  \ in the country's most populous city, they are domestically owned, they perform general industrial\
  \ or commercial activities, and they have certain levels of start-up capital, employees, and turnover.\
  \ \n\nThe Doing Business methodology on business taxes is consistent with the Total Tax Contribution\
  \ framework developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers (now PwC), which measures the taxes that are borne by\
  \ companies and that affect their income statements. However, PwC bases its calculation on data from\
  \ the largest companies in the economy, while Doing Business focuses on a standardized medium-size company."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The data covering taxes payable by businesses, measure all taxes and
  contributions that are government mandated (at any level - federal, state, or local), apply to standardized
  businesses, and have an impact in their income statements. The taxes covered go beyond the definition
  of a tax for government national accounts (compulsory, unrequited payments to general government) and
  also measure any imposts that affect business accounts. The main differences are in labor contributions
  and value added taxes.


  The data account for government-mandated contributions paid by the employer to a requited private pension
  fund or workers insurance fund but exclude value added taxes because they do not affect the accounting
  profits of the business - that is, they are not reflected in the income statement.'
