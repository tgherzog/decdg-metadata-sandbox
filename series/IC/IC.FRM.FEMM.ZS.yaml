description: Firms with female top manager refers to the percentage of firms in the private sector who
  have females as top managers. Top manager refers to the highest ranking manager or CEO of the establishment.
  This person may be the owner if he/she works as the manager of the firm. The results are based on surveys
  of more than 100,000 private firms.
Aggregationmethod: Unweighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Firms evaluating investment options, governments interested in improving business
  conditions, and economists seeking to explain economic performance have all grappled with defining and
  measuring the business environment. The firm-level data from Enterprise Surveys provide a useful tool
  for benchmarking economies across a large number of indicators measured at the firm level.


  Firms with female top manager measures women''s integration as decision makers. Benchmarking firms with
  female top manager is important to achieving gender equality promotion and empowerment of women. The
  gender topic provides information about women''s entrepreneurship and economic participation in the
  labor force.'
Generalcomments: 'Relevance to gender indicator: Women are vastly underrepresented in decision making
  positions at the top level in the private sector and this indicator monitors progress that has been
  made.'

Limitationsandexceptions: "The sampling methodology for Enterprise Surveys is stratified random sampling.
   In a simple random sample, all members of the population have the same probability of being selected
   and no weighting of the observations is necessary. In a stratified random sample, all population units
   are grouped within homogeneous groups and simple random samples are selected within each group. This
   method allows computing estimates for each of the strata with a specified level of precision while
   population estimates can also be estimated by properly weighting individual observations. The sampling
   weights take care of the varying probabilities of selection across different strata. Under certain
   conditions, estimates' precision under stratified random sampling will be higher than under simple
   random sampling (lower standard errors may result from the estimation procedure).\n\nThe strata for
   Enterprise Surveys are firm size, business sector, and geographic region within a country. Firm size
   levels are 5-19 (small), 20-99 (medium), and 100+ employees (large-sized firms). Since in most economies,
   the majority of firms are small and medium-sized, Enterprise Surveys oversample large firms since larger
   firms tend to be engines of job creation. Sector breakdown is usually manufacturing, retail, and other
   services. For larger economies, specific manufacturing sub-sectors are selected as additional strata
   on the basis of employment, value-added, and total number of establishments figures. Geographic regions
   within a country are selected based on which cities/regions collectively contain the majority of economic
   activity.\n\nIdeally the survey sample frame is derived from the universe of eligible firms obtained
   from the country\u2019s statistical office. Sometimes the master list of firms is obtained from other
   government agencies such as tax or business licensing authorities. In some cases, the list of firms
   is obtained from business associations or marketing databases. In a few cases, the sample frame is
   created via block enumeration, where the World Bank \u201Cmanually\u201D constructs a list of eligible
   firms after 1) partitioning a country\u2019s cities of major economic activity into clusters and blocks,
   2) randomly selecting a subset of blocks which will then be enumerated. In surveys conducted since
   2005-06, survey documentation which explains the source of the sample frame and any special circumstances
   encountered during survey fieldwork are included with the collected datasets.\n\nObtaining panel data,
   i.e. interviews with the same firms across multiple years, is a priority in current Enterprise Surveys.
   When conducting a new Enterprise Survey in a country where data was previously collected, maximal effort
   is expended to re-interview as many firms (from the prior survey) as possible. For these panel firms,
   sampling weights can be adjusted to take into account the resulting altered probabilities of inclusion
   in the sample frame."
Notesfromoriginalsource: All surveys were administered using the Enterprise Surveys methodology as outlined
  in the Methodology page which can be found from www.enterprisesurveys.org.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Firm-level surveys have been conducted since the 1990's by different
   units within the World Bank. Since 2005-06, most data collection efforts have been centralized within
   the Enterprise Analysis Unit. Surveys implemented by the Enterprise Analysis Unit follow the Global
   Methodology.\n\nPrivate contractors conduct the Enterprise Surveys on behalf of the World Bank. Due
   to sensitive survey questions addressing business-government relations and bribery-related topics,
   private contractors, rather than any government agency or an organization/institution associated with
   government, are hired by the World Bank to collect the data.\n\nConfidentiality of the survey respondents
   and the sensitive information they provide is necessary to ensure the greatest degree of survey participation,
   integrity and confidence in the quality of the data. Surveys are usually carried out in cooperation
   with business organizations and government agencies promoting job creation and economic growth, but
   confidentiality is never compromised.\n\nThe Enterprise Survey is answered by business owners and top
   managers. Sometimes the survey respondent calls company accountants and human resource managers into
   the interview to answer questions in the sales and labor sections of the survey. Typically 1200-1800
   interviews are conducted in larger economies, 360 interviews are conducted in medium-sized economies,
   and for smaller economies, 150 interviews take place.\n\nThe manufacturing and services sectors are
   the primary business sectors of interest. This corresponds to firms classified with ISIC codes 15-37,
   45, 50-52, 55, 60-64, and 72 (ISIC Rev.3.1). Formal (registered) companies with 5 or more employees
   are targeted for interview. Services firms include construction, retail, wholesale, hotels, restaurants,
   transport, storage, communications, and IT. Firms with 100% government/state ownership are not eligible
   to participate in an Enterprise Survey. Occasionally, for a few surveyed countries, other sectors are
   included in the companies surveyed such as education or health-related businesses. In each country,
   businesses in the cities/regions of major economic activity are interviewed.\n\nIn some countries,
   other surveys, which depart from the usual Enterprise Survey methodology, are conducted. Examples include
   1) Informal Surveys- surveys of informal (unregistered) enterprises, 2) Micro Surveys- surveys fielded
   to registered firms with less than five employees, and 3) Financial Crisis Assessment Surveys- short
   surveys administered by telephone to assess the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\n\
  \nThe Enterprise Surveys Unit uses two instruments: the Manufacturing Questionnaire and the Services
   Questionnaire. Although many questions overlap, some are only applicable to one type of business. For
   example, retail firms are not asked about production and nonproduction workers.\n\nThe standard Enterprise
   Survey topics include firm characteristics, gender participation, access to finance, annual sales,
   costs of inputs/labor, workforce composition, bribery, licensing, infrastructure, trade, crime, competition,
   capacity utilization, land and permits, taxation, informality, business-government relations, innovation
   and technology, and performance measures.\n\nOver 90% of the questions objectively ascertain characteristics
   of a country\u2019s business environment. The remaining questions assess the survey respondents\u2019\
   opinions on what are the obstacles to firm growth and performance. The mode of data collection is face-to-face
   interviews."
