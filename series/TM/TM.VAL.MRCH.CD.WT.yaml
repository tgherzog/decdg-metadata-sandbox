Limitationsandexceptions: 'The value of imports is generally recorded as the cost of the goods when purchased
  by the importer plus the cost of transport and insurance to the frontier of the importing country -
  the cost, insurance, and freight (c.i.f.) value, corresponding to the landed cost at the point of entry
  of foreign goods into the country. A few countries collect import data on a free on board (f.o.b.) basis
  and adjust them for freight and insurance costs.


  Countries may report trade according to the general or special system of trade. Under the general system
  imports include goods imported for domestic consumption and imports into bonded warehouses and free
  trade zones. Under the special system imports comprise goods imported for domestic consumption (including
  transformation and repair) and withdrawals for domestic consumption from bonded warehouses and free
  trade zones. Goods transported through a country en route to another are excluded.


  Data on imports of goods are derived from the same sources as data on exports. In principle, world exports
  and imports should be identical. Similarly, exports from an economy should equal the sum of imports
  by the rest of the world from that economy. But differences in timing and definitions result in discrepancies
  in reported values at all levels.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Merchandise trade data are from customs reports of goods moving into
  or out of an economy or from reports of financial transactions related to merchandise trade recorded
  in the balance of payments. Because of differences in timing and definitions, trade flow estimates from
  customs reports and balance of payments may differ. Several international agencies process trade data,
  each correcting unreported or misreported data, leading to other differences.


  The data on total imports of goods (merchandise) are from the World Trade Organization (WTO), which
  obtains data from national statistical offices and the IMF''s International Financial Statistics, supplemented
  by the Comtrade database and publications or databases of regional organizations, specialized agencies,
  economic groups, and private sources (such as Eurostat, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and country
  reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit). Country websites and email contact have improved collection
  of up-to-date statistics, reducing the proportion of estimates. The WTO database now covers most major
  traders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which together with high-income countries account for nearly
  95 percent of world trade. Reliability of data for countries in Europe and Central Asia has also improved.'
