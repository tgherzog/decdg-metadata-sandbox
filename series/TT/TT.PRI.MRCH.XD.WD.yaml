description: "Net barter terms of trade index is calculated as the percentage ratio of the export unit
   value indexes to the import unit value indexes, measured relative to the base year 2000. Unit value
   indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls,
   supplemented by UNCTAD's estimates using the previous year\u2019s trade values at the Standard International
   Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest
   periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification
   of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD\u2019s Commodity Price Statistics,
   interna\xADtional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value
   indexes at the country level using the current year's trade values as weights."

Developmentrelevance: "Data on international trade in goods are available from each country's balance
   of payments and customs records. While the balance of payments focuses on the financial transactions
   that accompany trade, customs data record the direction of trade and the physical quantities and value
   of goods entering or leaving the customs area. Customs data may differ from data recorded in the balance
   of payments because of differences in valuation and time of recording. The 2008 United Nations System
   of National Accounts and the sixth edition of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Balance
   of Payments Manual attempted to reconcile definitions and reporting standards for international trade
   statistics, but differences in sources, timing, and national practices limit comparability. Real growth
   rates derived from trade volume indexes and terms of trade based on unit price indexes may therefore
   differ from those derived from national accounts aggregates.\n\nTrade in goods, or merchandise trade,
   includes all goods that add to or subtract from an economy's material resources. Trade data are collected
   on the basis of a country's customs area, which in most cases is the same as its geographic area. Goods
   provided as part of foreign aid are included, but goods destined for extraterritorial agencies (such
   as embassies) are not.\n\nBy international agreement customs data are reported to the United Nations
   Statistics Division, which maintains the Commodity Trade (Comtrade) and Monthly Bulletin of Statistics
   databases. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) compiles international trade
   statistics, including price, value, and volume indexes, from national and international sources such
   as the IMF\u2019s International Financial Statistics database, the United Nations Economic Commission
   for Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Japan Customs, Bank of Japan,
   and UNCTAD\u2019s Commodity Price Statistics and Merchandise Trade Matrix. The IMF also compiles data
   on trade prices and volumes in its International Financial Statistics (IFS) database."

Limitationsandexceptions: Collecting and tabulating trade statistics are difficult. Some developing countries
  lack the capacity to report timely data, especially landlocked countries and countries whose territorial
  boundaries are porous. Their trade has to be estimated from the data reported by their partners. Countries
  that belong to common customs unions may need to collect data through direct inquiry of companies. Economic
  or political concerns may lead some national authorities to suppress or misrepresent data on certain
  trade flows, such as oil, military equipment, or the exports of a dominant producer. In other cases
  reported trade data may be distorted by deliberate under- or over-invoicing to affect capital transfers
  or avoid taxes. And in some regions smuggling and black market trading result in unreported trade flows.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The terms of trade index measures the relative prices of a country's
  exports and imports. There are several ways to calculate it. The most common is the net barter (or commodity)
  terms of trade index, or the ratio of the export price index to the import price index. When a country's
  net barter terms of trade index increases, its exports become more expensive or its imports become cheaper.
