Developmentrelevance: "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines a protected area\
  \ as \"a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other\
  \ effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services\
  \ and cultural values.\"\n\nTerrestrial protected areas are totally or partially protected areas of\
  \ at least 1,000 hectares that are designated by national authorities as scientific reserves with limited\
  \ public access, national parks, natural monuments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected\
  \ landscapes, and areas managed mainly for sustainable use.\n\nMarine protected areas are areas of intertidal\
  \ or subtidal terrain - and overlying water and associated flora and fauna and historical and cultural\
  \ features - that have been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or the entire enclosed\
  \ environment. Sites protected under local or provincial law are excluded.\n\nAs threats to biodiversity\
  \ mount, the international community is increasingly focusing on conserving diversity. Deforestation\
  \ is a major cause of loss of biodiversity, and habitat conservation is vital for stemming this loss.\
  \ Conservation efforts have focused on protecting areas of high biodiversity. Increasing the proportion\
  \ of terrestrial and marine areas protected helps defend vulnerable plant and animal species and safeguard\
  \ biodiversity.\n \nProtected areas remain the fundamental building blocks of virtually all national\
  \ and international conservation strategies, supported by governments and international institutions.\
  \ They provide the core of efforts to protect the world's threatened species and are increasingly recognized\
  \ as essential providers of ecosystem services and biological resources. Some sites are owned and managed\
  \ by governments, others by private individuals, companies, communities and faith groups.\n\nThe Sustainable\
  \ Development Goals (SDGs) address concerns common to all economies. In recognition of the vulnerability\
  \ of animal and plant species, SDGs include targets 14 and 15 to highlight the importance of marine\
  \ and terrestorial protected areas. Increasing the proportion of terrestrial and marine areas protected\
  \ helps defend vulnerable plant and animal species and safeguard biodiversity."

Limitationsandexceptions: "The data source for this indicator is the World Database on Protected Areas\
  \ (WDPA), the most comprehensive global dataset on marine and terrestrial protected areas available.\
  \ \n\nThe extent to which the land areas, including inland waters, and territorial waters of a country/territory\
  \ are protected is useful for planning purpose to protect biodiversity. However, it is neither an indication\
  \ of how well managed the terrestrial and marine protected areas are, nor confirmation that protection\
  \ measures are effectively enforced. Further, the indicator does not provide information on non-designated\
  \ or internationally designated protected areas that may also be important for conserving biodiversity.\
  \ There are known data and knowledge gaps for some countries/regions due to difficulties in reporting\
  \ national protected area data to the WDPA and/or determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition\
  \ of a protected area.\n\nGaps and/or time lags in reporting national protected area data to the WDPA\
  \ can however result in discrepancies, which are resolved in communication with data providers. The\
  \ World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) compiles data on protected areas, numbers of certain species,\
  \ and numbers of those species under threat from various sources. Because of differences in definitions,\
  \ reporting practices, and reporting periods, cross-country comparability is limited.\n\nDue to variations\
  \ in consistency and methods of collection, data quality is highly variable across countries. Some countries\
  \ update their information more frequently than others, some have more accurate data on extent of coverage,\
  \ and many underreport the number or extent of protected areas."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'This indicator is calculated using all the nationally designated protected
  areas recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) whose location and extent is known. The
  WDPA database is stored within a Geographic Information System (GIS) that stores information about protected
  areas such as their name, type and date of designation, documented area, geographic location (point)
  and/or boundary (polygon).


  A GIS analysis is used to calculate terrestrial and marine protection. For this a global protected area
  layer is created by combining the polygons and points recorded in the WDPA. Circular buffers are created
  around points based on the known extent of protected areas for which no polygon is available. Annual
  protected area layers are created by dissolving the global protected area layer by the known year of
  establishment of protected areas recorded in the WDPA. The annual protected area layers are overlaid
  with country/territory boundaries, coastlines and buffered coastlines (delineating the territorial waters)
  to obtain the absolute coverage (in square kilometers) of protected areas by country/territory per year
  from 1990 to present. The total area of a country''s/territory''s terrestrial protected areas and marine
  protected areas in territorial waters is divided by the total area of its land areas (including inland
  waters) and territorial waters to obtain the relative coverage (percentage) of protected areas.'

description: Terrestrial protected areas are totally or partially protected areas of at least 1,000 hectares
  that are designated by national authorities as scientific reserves with limited public access, national
  parks, natural monuments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes, and areas managed
  mainly for sustainable use. Marine protected areas are areas of intertidal or subtidal terrain--and
  overlying water and associated flora and fauna and historical and cultural features--that have been
  reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment. Sites protected
  under local or provincial law are excluded.
