Developmentrelevance: 'While some countries have an abundant supply of fresh water, others do not have
  as much. UN estimates that many areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability.
  Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person
  uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. The ability of developing countries
  to make more water available for domestic, agricultural, industrial and environmental uses will depend
  on better management of water resources and more cross-sectorial planning and integration. According
  to World Water Council, by 2020, water use is expected to increase by 40 percent, and 17 percent more
  water will be required for food production to meet the needs of the growing population. The three major
  factors causing increasing water demand over the past century are population growth, industrial development
  and the expansion of irrigated agriculture.


  There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will
  continue to have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability,
  water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels. Properly managed
  water resources are a critical component of growth, poverty reduction and equity. The livelihoods of
  the poorest are critically associated with access to water services. A shortage of water in the future
  would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall
  health and the production of grain.


  Freshwater use by continents is partly based on several socio-economic development factors, including
  population, physiography, and climatic characteristics. It is estimated that in the coming decades the
  most intensive growth of water withdrawal is expected to occur in Africa and South America (increasing
  by 1.5-1.6 times), while the smallest growth will take place in Europe and North America (1.2 times).'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'A common perception is that most of the available freshwater resources are
  visible (on the surfaces of lakes, reservoirs and rivers). However, this visible water represents only
  a tiny fraction of global freshwater resources, as most of it is stored in aquifers, with the largest
  stocks stored in solid form in the Antarctic and in Greenland''s ice cap.


  The data on freshwater resources are based on estimates of runoff into rivers and recharge of groundwater.
  These estimates are based on different sources and refer to different years, so cross-country comparisons
  should be made with caution. Because the data are collected intermittently, they may hide significant
  variations in total renewable water resources from year to year. The data also fail to distinguish between
  seasonal and geographic variations in water availability within countries. Data for small countries
  and countries in arid and semiarid zones are less reliable than those for larger countries and countries
  with greater rainfall.


  Caution should also be used in comparing data on annual freshwater withdrawals, which are subject to
  variations in collection and estimation methods. In addition, inflows and outflows are estimated at
  different times and at different levels of quality and precision, requiring caution in interpreting
  the data, particularly for water-short countries, notably in the Middle East and North Africa.


  The data are based on surveys and estimates provided by governments to the Joint Monitoring Programme
  of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children''s Fund (UNICEF). The coverage
  rates are based on information from service users on actual household use rather than on information
  from service providers, which may include nonfunctioning systems.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Annual freshwater withdrawals are total water withdrawals, not counting
  evaporation losses from storage basins. Withdrawals also include water from desalination plants in countries
  where they are a significant source. Withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of total renewable resources
  where extraction from nonrenewable aquifers or desalination plants is considerable or where water reuse
  is significant. Withdrawals for agriculture and industry are total withdrawals for irrigation and livestock
  production and for direct industrial use (including for cooling thermoelectric plants). Withdrawals
  for domestic uses include drinking water, municipal use or supply, and use for public services, commercial
  establishments, and homes.
