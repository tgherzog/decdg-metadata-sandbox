Developmentrelevance: 'Transport infrastructure - highways, railways, ports and waterways, and airports
  and air traffic control systems - and the services that flow from it are crucial to the activities of
  households, producers, and governments. Because performance indicators vary widely by transport mode
  and focus (whether physical infrastructure or the services flowing from that infrastructure), highly
  specialized and carefully specified indicators are required to measure a country''s transport infrastructure.


  The railway transport industry a vital engine of global socio-economic growth. It is of vital importance
  for economic development, creating direct and indirect employment, supporting tourism and local businesses.
  Economic growth, technological change, and market liberalization affect road transport throughout the
  world.


  Railways have helped in the industrialization process of a country by easy transportation of coal and
  raw-materials at a cheaper rate. As railways require huge capital outlay, they may give rise to monopolies
  and work against public interest at large. Even if controlled and managed by the government, lack of
  competition sometimes results in inefficiency and high costs. Also, many times it is not economical
  to operate railways in sparsely settled rural areas. Thus, in many developing countries large rural
  areas have no railway even today.


  Rail transport is a major form of passenger and freight transport in many countries. It is ubiquitous
  in Europe, with an integrated network covering virtually the whole continent. In India, China, South
  Korea and Japan, many millions use trains as regular transport. In the North America, freight rail transport
  is widespread and heavily used in for transporting gods. The western Europe region has the highest railway
  density in the world and has many individual trains which operate through several countries despite
  technical and organizational differences in each national network. Australia has a generally sparse
  network, mostly along its densely populated urban centers.'

Limitationsandexceptions: "Unlike the road sector, where numerous qualified motor vehicle operators can\
  \ operate anywhere on the road network, railways are a restricted transport system with vehicles confined\
  \ to a fixed guideway. Considering the cost and service characteristics, railways generally are best\
  \ suited to carry - and can effectively compete for - bulk commodities and containerized freight for\
  \ distances of 500-5,000 kilometers, and passengers for distances of 50-1,000 kilometers. Below these\
  \ limits road transport tends to be more competitive, while above these limits air transport for passengers\
  \ and freight and sea transport for freight tend to be more competitive. \n\nData for transport sectors\
  \ are not always internationally comparable. Unlike for demographic statistics, national income accounts,\
  \ and international trade data, the collection of infrastructure data has not been \"internationalized\"\
  . The data is based a reporting by the railway companies and it can show a drastic increase or decrease\
  \ for some of the years because of no reporting by some of the companies of a country."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Rail lines are the length of railway route available for train service,
  irrespective of the number of parallel tracks. It includes railway routes that are open for public passenger
  and freight servies and excludes dedicated private resource railways.
