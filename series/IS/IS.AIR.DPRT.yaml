description: Registered carrier departures worldwide are domestic takeoffs and takeoffs abroad of air
  carriers registered in the country.
Aggregationmethod: Sum
Developmentrelevance: 'Transport infrastructure - highways, railways, ports and waterways, and airports
  and air traffic control systems - and the services that flow from it are crucial to the activities of
  households, producers, and governments. Because performance indicators vary widely by transport mode
  and focus (whether physical infrastructure or the services flowing from that infrastructure), highly
  specialized and carefully specified indicators are required to measure a country''s transport infrastructure.


  The air transport industry a vital engine of global socio-economic growth. It is of vital importance
  for economic development, creating direct and indirect employment, supporting tourism and local businesses,
  and stimulating foreign investment and international trade. Economic growth, technological change, market
  liberalization, the growth of low cost carriers, airport congestion, oil prices and other trends affect
  commercial aviation throughout the world.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Countries submit air transport data to Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on
  the basis of standard instructions and definitions issued by ICAO. In many cases, however, the data
  include estimates by ICAO for nonreporting carriers. Where possible, these estimates are based on previous
  submissions supplemented by information published by the air carriers, such as flight schedules.


  The data cover the air traffic carried on scheduled services, but changes in air transport regulations
  in Europe have made it more difficult to classify traffic as scheduled or nonscheduled. Thus recent
  increases shown for some European countries may be due to changes in the classification of air traffic
  rather than actual growth. In the case of multinational air carriers owned by partner States, traffic
  within each partner State is shown separately as domestic and all other traffic as international.


  "Foreign" cabotage traffic (i.e. traffic carried between city-pairs in a State other than the one where
  the reporting carrier has its principal place of business) is shown as international traffic.


  A technical stop does not result in any flight stage being classified differently than would have been
  the case had the technical stop not been made. For countries with few air carriers or only one, the
  addition or discontinuation of a home-based air carrier may cause significant changes in air traffic.


  Data for transport sectors are not always internationally comparable. Unlike for demographic statistics,
  national income accounts, and international trade data, the collection of infrastructure data has not
  been "internationalized."'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The air transport data represent the total (international and domestic)
  scheduled traffic carried by the air carriers registered in a country. For statistical uses, departures
  are equal to the number of landings made or flight stages flown. A flight stage is the operation of
  an aircraft from take-off to its next landing. A flight stage is classified as either international
  or domestic. International flight stage is one or both terminals in the territory of a State, other
  than the State in which the air carrier has its principal place of business.


  Domestic flight stage is not classifiable as international. Domestic flight stages include all flight
  stages flown between points within the domestic boundaries of a State by an air carrier whose principal
  place of business is in that State. Flight stages between a State and territories belonging to it, as
  well as any flight stages between two such territories, should be classified as domestic. This applies
  even though a stage may cross international waters or over the territory of another State.'
