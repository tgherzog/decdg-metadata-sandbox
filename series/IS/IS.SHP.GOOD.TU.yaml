Developmentrelevance: 'Transport infrastructure - highways, railways, ports and waterways, and airports
  and air traffic control systems - and the services that flow from it are crucial to the activities of
  households, producers, and governments. Because performance indicators vary widely by transport mode
  and focus (whether physical infrastructure or the services flowing from that infrastructure), highly
  specialized and carefully specified indicators are required to measure a country''s transport infrastructure.


  The sea transport industry a vital engine of global socio-economic growth. It is of vital importance
  for economic development, creating direct and indirect employment, supporting tourism and local businesses,
  and stimulating foreign investment and international trade. Economic growth, technological change, market
  liberalization, and oil prices affect sea transport throughout the world.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Measures of port container traffic, much of it commodities of medium to high
  value added, give some indication of economic growth in a country. But when traffic is merely transshipment,
  much of the economic benefit goes to the terminal operator and ancillary services for ships and containers
  rather than to the country more broadly. In transshipment centers empty containers may account for as
  much as 40 percent of traffic.


  Data cover coastal shipping as well as international journeys. Transshipment traffic is counted as two
  lifts at the intermediate port (once to off-load and again as an outbound lift) and includes empty units.
  Data for transport sectors are not always internationally comparable. Unlike for demographic statistics,
  national income accounts, and international trade data, the collection of infrastructure data has not
  been "internationalized."'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: TEU is the standard unit, referring to 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long
  cargo container. The size of cargo containers range from 20 feet long to more than 50 feet long. The
  international measure is the smallest box, the 20-footer or 20-foot-equivalent unit (TEU). Two twenty-foot
  containers (TEUs) equal one FEU. Container vessel capacity and port throughput capacity are frequently
  referred to in TEUs. 2015 and 2016 figures comprise estimates for countries where current year statistics
  were not available. In these cases, estimates include averages and extrapolations from previous years'
  data.
