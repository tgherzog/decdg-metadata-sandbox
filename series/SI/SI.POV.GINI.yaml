description: Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption
  expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.
  A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number
  of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between
  the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum
  area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies
  perfect inequality.
Generalcomments: "The World Bank\u2019s internationally comparable poverty monitoring database now draws
   on income or detailed consumption data from more than one thousand six hundred household surveys across
   164 countries in six regions and 25 other high income countries (industrialized economies). While income
   distribution data are published for all countries with data available, poverty data are published for
   low- and middle-income countries and countries eligible to receive loans from the World Bank (such
   as Chile) and recently graduated countries (such as Estonia) only. See PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/WhatIsNew.aspx)
   for definitions of geographical regions and industrialized countries."

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Gini coefficients are not unique. It is possible for two different Lorenz curves
  to give rise to the same Gini coefficient. Furthermore it is possible for the Gini coefficient of a
  developing country to rise (due to increasing inequality of income) while the number of people in absolute
  poverty decreases. This is because the Gini coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth.


  Another limitation of the Gini coefficient is that it is not additive across groups, i.e. the total
  Gini of a society is not equal to the sum of the Gini''s for its sub-groups. Thus, country-level Gini
  coefficients cannot be aggregated into regional or global Gini''s, although a Gini coefficient can be
  computed for the aggregate.


  Because the underlying household surveys differ in methods and types of welfare measures collected,
  data are not strictly comparable across countries or even across years within a country. Two sources
  of non-comparability should be noted for distributions of income in particular. First, the surveys can
  differ in many respects, including whether they use income or consumption expenditure as the living
  standard indicator. The distribution of income is typically more unequal than the distribution of consumption.
  In addition, the definitions of income used differ more often among surveys. Consumption is usually
  a much better welfare indicator, particularly in developing countries. Second, households differ in
  size (number of members) and in the extent of income sharing among members. And individuals differ in
  age and consumption needs. Differences among countries in these respects may bias comparisons of distribution.
  


  World Bank staff have made an effort to ensure that the data are as comparable as possible. Wherever
  possible, consumption has been used rather than income. Income distribution and Gini indexes for high-income
  economies are calculated directly from the Luxembourg Income Study database, using an estimation method
  consistent with that applied for developing countries.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical
  line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. A Lorenz curve
  plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients,
  starting with the poorest individual. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index
  of 100 implies perfect inequality.


  The Gini index provides a convenient summary measure of the degree of inequality. Data on the distribution
  of income or consumption come from nationally representative household surveys. Where the original data
  from the household survey were available, they have been used to calculate the income or consumption
  shares by quintile. Otherwise, shares have been estimated from the best available grouped data.


  The distribution data have been adjusted for household size, providing a more consistent measure of
  per capita income or consumption. No adjustment has been made for spatial differences in cost of living
  within countries, because the data needed for such calculations are generally unavailable. For further
  details on the estimation method for low- and middle-income economies, see Ravallion and Chen (1996).


  Survey year is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data
  collection period bridged two calendar years, the year in which most of the data were collected.'
