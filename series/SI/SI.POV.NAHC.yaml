description: National poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national
  poverty line(s). National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household
  surveys. For economies for which the data are from EU-SILC, the reported year is the income reference
  year, which is the year before the survey year.
Generalcomments: This series only includes estimates that to the best of our knowledge are reasonably
  comparable over time for a country. Due to differences in estimation methodologies and poverty lines,
  estimates should not be compared across countries.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Poverty headcount ratio among the population is measured based on national
  (i.e. country-specific) poverty lines. A country may have a unique national poverty line or separate
  poverty lines for rural and urban areas, or for different geographic areas to reflect differences in
  the cost of living or sometimes to reflect differences in diets and consumption baskets.


  Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally
  representative samples of households. These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute
  a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from
  own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita
  consumption or income. 


  National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with
  the country''s specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions
  of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary
  between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide
  a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty
  lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding
  and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies. 


  Almost all national poverty lines in developing economies are anchored to the cost of a food bundle
  - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health
  and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted
  for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons
  of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically
  recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be
  deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. 


  This series only includes estimates that to the best of our knowledge are reasonably comparable over
  time for a country. For economies for which the data are from EU-SILC, the reported year is the income
  reference year, which is the year before the survey year. For all other economies, the year reported
  is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection
  period bridged two calendar years, the year in which data collection started.'
