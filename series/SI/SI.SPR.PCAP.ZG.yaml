Generalcomments: The comparability of welfare aggregates (consumption or income) for the chosen years
  T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern
  for a country, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year(s). Annualized
  growth rates are calculated between the survey years, using a compound growth formula. The survey years
  defining the period for which growth rates are calculated and the type of welfare aggregate used to
  calculate the growth rates are noted in the footnotes.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Growth rates for Iraq are based on survey means of 2005 PPP$. The coverage
  and quality of the 2011 PPP price data for Iraq and most other North African and Middle Eastern countries
  were hindered by the exceptional period of instability they faced at the time of the 2011 exercise of
  the International Comparison Program. See PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet) for detailed
  explanations.


  Because household surveys are infrequent in most countries and are not aligned across countries, comparisons
  across countries or over time should be made with a high degree of caution.'

Shortdefinition: The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of total population is computed as annualized
  average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of total population from household surveys
  over a roughly 5-year period. Growth rates for most countries are based on survey means of 2011 PPP$.
  For Iraq, they are based on survey means of 2005 PPP$.

description: 'The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of the total population is computed as the annualized
  average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the total population in  the income
  distribution in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. Mean per capita real
  consumption or income is measured at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet).
  For some countries means are not reported due to grouped and/or confidential data. The annualized growth
  rate is computed as (Mean in final year/Mean in initial year)^(1/(Final year - Initial year)) - 1.  The
  reference year is the year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for
  which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year in which data were collected
  is reported. The initial year refers to the nearest survey collected 5 years before the most recent
  survey available, only surveys collected between 3 and 7 years before the most recent survey are considered.
  The final year refers to the most recent survey available between 2011 and 2015.
