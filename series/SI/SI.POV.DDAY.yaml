Developmentrelevance: 'The World Bank Group is committed to reducing extreme poverty to 3 percent or less,
  globally, by 2030. Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the
  national development agenda of many countries. The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates
  for developing countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household
  survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable
  expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys. The World
  Bank''s Development Research Group maintains a database that is updated annually as new survey data
  become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major reassessment
  of progress against poverty every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows users
  to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90, $3.20 and $5.50 a day global, regional and country-level
  poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for different poverty
  lines. The Poverty and Equity Data portal provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards
  with graphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for
  different regions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on
  the national poverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates, produced from and consistent
  with PovcalNet.'
Generalcomments: "The World Bank\u2019s internationally comparable poverty monitoring database now draws\
  \ on income or detailed consumption data from more than one thousand six hundred household surveys across\
  \ 164 countries in six regions and 25 other high income countries (industrialized economies). While\
  \ income distribution data are published for all countries with data available, poverty data are published\
  \ for low- and middle-income countries and countries eligible to receive loans from the World Bank (such\
  \ as Chile) and recently graduated countries (such as Estonia) only. The aggregated numbers for low-\
  \ and middle-income countries correspond to the totals of 6 regions in PovcalNet, which include low-\
  \ and middle-income countries and countries eligible to receive loans from the World Bank (such as Chile)\
  \ and recently graduated countries (such as Estonia). See PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/WhatIsNew.aspx)\

Limitationsandexceptions: "Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain.\
  \ The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys need to increase substantially,\
  \ particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains\
  \ low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income\
  \ countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create\
  \ uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. \n\nBesides the frequency and timeliness of survey\
  \ data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed\
  \ questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel.\
  \ Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion\
  \ of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption\
  \ data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds\
  \ of countries.\n\nHowever, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences\
  \ in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels\
  \ of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of\
  \ the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own\
  \ production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total\
  \ consumption expenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or\
  \ income from own production, but valuation methods vary."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'International comparisons of poverty estimates entail both conceptual
  and practical problems. Countries have different definitions of poverty, and consistent comparisons
  across countries can be difficult. Local poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich
  countries, where more generous standards are used, than in poor countries.


  Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring
  extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world''s poorest countries. The welfare of people
  living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the
  purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international
  prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (PPPs), was chosen for World Development
  Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences
  in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically
  updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when
  we adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update
  set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international
  poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done
  when making comparisons over time. The $3.20 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines
  in countries classified as Lower Middle Income. The $5.50 poverty line is derived from typical national
  poverty lines in countries classified as Upper Middle Income.


  Early editions of World Development Indicators used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values
  in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993,
  2005, and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank. The current extreme poverty line
  is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines found in 15
  of the poorest countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard
  for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it
  using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. As a result of revisions
  in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates
  reported in earlier editions.


  The statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income surveys.
  Analysis of some 20 countries for which income and consumption expenditure data were both available
  from the same surveys found income to yield a higher mean than consumption but also higher inequality.
  When poverty measures based on consumption and income were compared, the two effects roughly cancelled
  each other out: there was no significant statistical difference.'
