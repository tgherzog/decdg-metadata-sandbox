description: Mean consumption or income per capita (2011 PPP $ per day) used in calculating the growth
  rate in the welfare aggregate of the bottom 40% of the population in the income distribution in a country.
Generalcomments: The choice of consumption or income for a country is made according to which welfare
  aggregate is used to estimate extreme poverty in PovcalNet. The practice adopted by the World Bank for
  estimating global and regional poverty is, in principle, to use per capita consumption expenditure as
  the welfare measure wherever available; and to use income as the welfare measure for countries for which
  consumption is unavailable. However, in some cases data on consumption may be available but are outdated
  or not shared with the World Bank for recent survey years. In these cases, if data on income are available,
  income is used. Whether data are for consumption or income per capita is noted in the footnotes. Because
  household surveys are infrequent in most countries and are not aligned across countries, comparisons
  across countries or over time should be made with a high degree of caution.
