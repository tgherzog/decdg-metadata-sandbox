Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Good nutrition is the cornerstone for survival, health and development. Well-nourished
  children perform better in school, grow into healthy adults and in turn give their children a better
  start in life. Well-nourished women face fewer risks during pregnancy and childbirth, and their children
  set off on firmer developmental paths, both physically and mentally (UNICEF www.childinfo.org).

Limitationsandexceptions: From a policy and program standpoint, this measure has its limits. First, food
  insecurity exists even where food availability is not a problem because of inadequate access of poor
  households to food. Second, food insecurity is an individual or household phenomenon, and the average
  food available to each person, even corrected for possible effects of low income, is not a good predictor
  of food insecurity among the population. And third, nutrition security is determined not only by food
  security but also by the quality of care of mothers and children and the quality of the household's
  health environment (Smith and Haddad 2000).

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on undernourishment are from the Food and Agriculture Organization
  (FAO) of the United Nations and measure food deprivation based on average food available for human consumption
  per person, the level of inequality in access to food, and the minimum calories required for an average
  person.
Topic: 'Health: Nutrition'
description: Population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption (also referred to as prevalence
  of undernourishment) shows the percentage of the population whose food intake is insufficient to meet
  dietary energy requirements continuously. Data showing as 5 may signify a prevalence of undernourishment
  below 5%.
