description: 'Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D), expressed as a percent of
  GDP. They include both capital and current expenditures in the four main sectors: Business enterprise,
  Government, Higher education and Private non-profit. R&D covers basic research, applied research, and
  experimental development.'
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Expenditure on research and development (R&D) is a key indicator of government and
  private sector efforts to obtain competitive advantage in science and technology.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Estimates of the resources allocated to R&D are affected by national characteristics
  such as the periodicity and coverage of national R&D surveys across institutional sectors and industries;
  and the use of different sampling and estimation methods. R&D typically involves a few large performers,
  hence R&D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while
  attempting to identify new or occasional performers. 


  R&D totals from SNA accounts may differ from these estimates, due in part to the different treatments
  of software R&D in the totals.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The gross domestic expenditure on R&D indicator consists of the total
  expenditure (current and capital) on R&D by all resident companies, research institutes, university
  and government laboratories, etc. It excludes R&D expenditures financed by domestic firms but performed
  abroad. 


  The OECD''s Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as "creative work undertaken
  on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture
  and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications." R&D covers basic research,
  applied research, and experimental development.


  (1) Basic research - Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire
  new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular
  application or use in view


  (2) Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire
  new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.


  (3) Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge
  gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products
  or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already
  produced or installed.


  The fields of science and technology used to classify R&D according to the Revised Fields of Science
  and Technology Classification are:

  1. Natural sciences;

  2. Engineering and technology;

  3. Medical and health sciences;

  4. Agricultural sciences;

  5. Social sciences;

  6. Humanities and the arts.


  The data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering
  R&D performing entities in the private and public sectors.'
