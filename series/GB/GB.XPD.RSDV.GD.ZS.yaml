Limitationsandexceptions: "Estimates of the resources allocated to R&D are affected by national characteristics\
  \ such as the periodicity and coverage of national R&D surveys across institutional sectors and industries;\
  \ and the use of different sampling and estimation methods. R&D typically involves a few large performers,\
  \ hence R&D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while\
  \ attempting to identify new or occasional performers. \n\nR&D totals from SNA accounts may differ from\
  \ these estimates, due in part to the different treatments of software R&D in the totals."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "The gross domestic expenditure on R&D indicator consists of the total\
  \ expenditure (current and capital) on R&D by all resident companies, research institutes, university\
  \ and government laboratories, etc. It excludes R&D expenditures financed by domestic firms but performed\
  \ abroad. \n\nThe OECD's Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as \"creative\
  \ work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge\
  \ of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\"\
  \ R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.\n\n(1) Basic research -\
  \ Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of\
  \ the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or\
  \ use in view\n\n(2) Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in\
  \ order to acquire new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim\
  \ or objective.\n\n(3) Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing\
  \ on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing\
  \ new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving\
  \ substantially those already produced or installed.\n\nThe fields of science and technology used to\
  \ classify R&D according to the Revised Fields of Science and Technology Classification are:\n1. Natural\
  \ sciences;\n2. Engineering and technology;\n3. Medical and health sciences;\n4. Agricultural sciences;\n\
  5. Social sciences;\n6. Humanities and the arts.\n\nThe data are obtained through statistical surveys\
  \ which are regularly conducted at national level covering R&D performing entities in the private and\
  \ public sectors."
