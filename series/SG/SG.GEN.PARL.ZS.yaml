description: Women in parliaments are the percentage of parliamentary seats in a single or lower chamber
  held by women.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Despite much progress in recent decades, gender inequalities remain pervasive in
  many dimensions of life - worldwide. But while disparities exist throughout the world, they are most
  prevalent in developing countries. Gender inequalities in the allocation of such resources as education,
  health care, nutrition, and political voice matter because of the strong association with well-being,
  productivity, and economic growth. These patterns of inequality begin at an early age, with boys routinely
  receiving a larger share of education and health spending than do girls, for example.


  Women are vastly underrepresented in decision-making positions in government, although there is some
  evidence of recent improvement. Gender parity in parliamentary representation is still far from being
  realized. Without representation at this level, it is difficult for women to influence policy.


  A strong and vibrant democracy is possible only when parliament is fully inclusive of the population
  it represents. Parliaments cannot consider themselves inclusive, however, until they can boast the full
  participation of women. This is not just about women''s right to equality and their contribution to
  the conduct of public affairs, but also about using women''s resources and potential to determine political
  and development priorities that benefit societies and the global community.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of
  parliaments. There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements
  due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track
  of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are. Parliaments
  vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government
  and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women''s contribution to political decision making,
  this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently
  carrying out their parliamentary mandate.


  The data is compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the basis of information provided by National
  Parliaments. The percentages do not take into account the case of parliaments for which no data was
  available at that date. Information is available in all countries where a national legislature exists
  and therefore does not include parliaments that have been dissolved or suspended for an indefinite period.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments is the
  number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed
  as a percentage of all occupied seats; it is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied
  by women by the total number of seats in parliament.


  National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral
  parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral
  parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be
  filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election. Seats refer
  to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of members of parliament.'

  BGD: 'In 2004, the number of seats in parliament was raised from 300 to 345, with the addition of 45
    reserved seats for women. These reserved seats were filled in September and October 2005, being allocated
    to political parties in proportion to their share of the national vote received in the 2001 election.
    

    The parliament was dissolved on 27 October 2006, in view of elections that are yet to take place.
    Women held 52 of the 345 seats (15%) in the outgoing parliament. 

    45 reserved seats reserved for women are yet to be filled in 2008.'
  EGY: Figures correspond to the results of elections to the Lower House completed in January 2012. Elections
    to the Upper House will be completed in early 2012.
  GEO: Elections were held in November 2003. However, on 25 November 2003, the election results were annuled
    by the Supreme Court of Georgia. New elections will be held in March 2004.
  GIN: The parliament was dissolved following the December 2008 coup
  KEN: Situation for 1 January 2008 for directly elected members endorsed by the electoral commission.
    The additional twelve appointed seats and two ex-officio seats had yet to be filled.
  KWT: No woman candidate was elected in the 2006 elections. However, one woman, appointed to the 16-member
    cabinet, is counted, because cabinet ministers also sit in parliament. In 2008, two women were appointed
    to the 16-member cabinet sworn in June 2008.
  LBY: Following the popular uprising and protracted fighting that eventually ousted Col. Muammar Gaddafi,
    the General People's Congress - the unicameral parliament of the now defunct Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
    - has ceased to function. Parliamentary elections are expected to be held in 2012 under the supervision
    of the National Transitional Council, the interim government of the new Libya.
  NAM: The 6 additional non-voting members will be appointed by the President of the Republic after he
    will be sworn in on 21 March 2005.
  SGP: The parliament convened on 2 November 2006 following the elections held in May. Nine members are
    yet to be appointed to the parliament.
  TLS: The purpose of elections held on 30 August 2001 was to elect members of the Constituent Assembly
    of Timor-Leste. This body became the National Parliament on 20 May 2002, the date on which the country
    became independent, without any new elections
  TON: No women were elected in 2008, however one woman was appointed to the Cabinet. As cabinet ministers
    also sit in parliament, there is one woman out of a total of 32 members.
  USA: The total refers to all voting members of the House.
  VEN: On 25 August 1999, the Constituent Assembly elected on 25 July adopted a dercree putting the bicameral
    Congress on indefinite recess
  ZAF: The figures for 1999-2017 on the distribution of seats do not include the 36 special rotating delegates
    appointed on an ad hoc basis, and all percentages given are therefore calculated on the basis of the
    54 permanent seats.
