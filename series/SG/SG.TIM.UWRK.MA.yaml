description: The average time men spend on household provision of services for own consumption.  Data
  are expressed as a proportion of time in a day. Domestic and care work includes food preparation, dishwashing,
  cleaning and upkeep of a dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation,
  servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled
  household members, among others.
Developmentrelevance: Women often spend disproportionately more time on unpaid domestic and care work
  than men.  This unequal division of responsibilities is correlated with gender differences in economic
  opportunities, includign low female labor force participation, occupational sex segregation, and earnings
  diffrentials.  The need for a gender balance  in the distribution of unpaid domestic and care work has
  been increasingly recognized and the Sustainable Development Goals address the issue in the target 5.4.
