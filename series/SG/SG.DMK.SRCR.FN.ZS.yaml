description: "Proportion of women ages 15-49 years (married or in union) who make their own decision on
   all three selected areas i.e. can say no to sexual intercourse with their husband or partner if they
   do not want; decide on use of contraception; and decide on their own health care. Only women who provide
   a \u201Cyes\u201D answer to all three components are considered as women who \u201Cmake her own decisions
   regarding sexual and reproductive\u201D."
Developmentrelevance: "Women\u2018s participation in decisions being made in their own households, that
   is households in which they usually live with their spouse and/or children with or without others,
   is widely accepted as a universal indicator of women\u2018s empowerment. The ability of women to make
   decisions that affect their personal circumstances is an essential element of their empowerment and
   serves as an important contributor to their overall development."

Limitationsandexceptions: Current estimates of the indicator are based on currently married or in union
  women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are using any type of contraception.  In the current
  Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS),  the question on decision-making on use of contraception is only
  asked to women who are currently using contraception. Because the questions on decision- making on sexual
  relations and health care are restricted to women (15-49) currently married or in union, the denominator
  for Indicator 5.6.1 is women 15-49, who are currently married or in union and currently using contraception.  However,
  agreement has been reached with Macro/ICF for upcoming DHS surveys to ask the question on decision on
  use of contraception to all married/ in union women aged 15-49 years, whether they are currently using
  any contraception or not. The DHS model questionnaire for Phase 7 already includes the question on decision-making
  for women who are not currently using any contraception.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Numerator of the indicator is number of married or in union women ages
  15-49 who have been interviewed and satisfy all three empowerment criteria: 1)who can say "no" to sex;
  and 2)for whom the decision on contraception is not mainly made by the husband/partner; and 3) for whom
  decision on health care for themselves ins not usually made by the husband/partner or someone else.  Denominator
  of the indicator is the total number of women ages 15-49 who are married or in union and who have been
  interviewed.'
