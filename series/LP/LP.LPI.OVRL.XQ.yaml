Developmentrelevance: 'The LPI measures on-the-ground trade logistics performance, helping national leaders,
  key policymakers, and private sector traders understand the challenges they and their trading partners
  face in reducing logistical barriers to international commerce.


  As the backbone of international trade, logistics encompasses freight transportation, warehousing, border
  clearance, payment systems, and many other functions. These functions are performed mostly by private
  service providers for private traders and owners of goods, but logistics is also important for the public
  policies of national governments and regional and international organizations. Because global supply
  chains are so varied and complex, the efficiency of logistics depends on government services, investments,
  and policies. Building infrastructure, developing a regulatory regime for transport services, and designing
  and implementing efficient customs clearance procedures are all areas where governments play an important
  role. The improvements in global logistics over the past two decades have been driven by innovation
  and a great increase in global trade. While policies and investments that enable good logistics practices
  help modernize the best-performing countries, logistics still lags in many developing countries. Indeed,
  the "logistics gap" evident in the first two editions of this report remains.


  The tremendous importance of logistics performance for economic growth, diversification, and poverty
  reduction has long been widely recognized. National governments can facilitate trade through investments
  in both "hard" and "soft" infrastructure. Countries have improved their logistics performance by implementing
  strategic and sustained interventions, mobilizing actors across traditional sector silos, and involving
  the private sector. Logistics is also increasingly important for sustainability. A focus on the environmental
  impacts of logistics practices was recently included in the LPI.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'The Logistics Performance Index is an interactive benchmarking tool created
  to help countries identify the challenges and opportunities they face in their performance on trade
  logistics and what they can do to improve their performance. Feedback from operators is supplemented
  with quantitative data on the performance of key components of the logistics chain in the country of
  work. Thus, the LPI consists of both qualitative and quantitative measures.


  In addition, despite being the most comprehensive data source for country logistics and trade facilitation,
  the LPI has two important limitations. First, the experience of international freight forwarders might
  not represent the broader logistics environment in poor countries, which often rely on traditional operators.
  And the international and traditional operators might differ in their interactions with government agencies
  - and in their service levels. Second, for landlocked countries and small-island states, the LPI might
  reflect access problems outside the country assessed, such as transit difficulties. The low rating of
  a landlocked country might not adequately reflect its trade facilitation efforts, which depend on the
  workings of complex international transit systems. Landlocked countries cannot eliminate transit inefficiencies
  with domestic reforms.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The indicator presents data from Logistics Performance Surveys conducted
  by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies
  and individuals engaged in international logistics.


  The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) uses a structured online survey of logistics professionals at
  multinational freight forwarders and at the main express carriers. The 2012 LPI data are based on the
  2011 survey, which was administered to nearly 1,000 respondents at international logistics companies
  in 143 countries (domestic performance indicators). The international LPI covers 155 countries. The
  LPI assesses both large companies and small and medium enterprises. Most of the responses are from small
  and medium enterprises, with large companies (those with 250 employees or more) accounting for roughly
  18 percent of responses. The respondents include groups of professionals who are directly involved in
  day-today operations, from company headquarters and from country offices such as senior executives,
  area or country managers, and department managers. Many of the respondents are at corporate or regional
  headquarters or at country branch offices. The rest are at local branch offices or independent firms.
  The majority of respondents are involved in providing most logistics services as their main line of
  work such as warehousing and distribution, customer-tailored logistics solutions, courier services,
  bulk or break bulk cargo transport, and less-than-full container, full-container, or full-trailer load
  transport.


  Each survey respondent rates eight overseas markets on six core components of logistics performance
  (the efficiency of customs and border management clearance, the quality of trade and transport infrastructure,
  the ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, the competence and quality of logistics services,
  the ability to track and trace consignments, and the frequency shipments reach consignees within scheduled
  or expected delivery times). The components are rated on a scale (lowest score to highest score) from
  1 to 5. The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the
  country where the respondent is located, on random selection, and - for landlocked countries - on neighboring
  countries that form part of the land bridge connecting them with international markets. The method used
  to select the group of countries rated by each respondent varies by the characteristics of the country
  where the respondent is located. If respondents did not provide information for all six components,
  interpolation is used to fill in missing values. The missing values are replaced with the country mean
  response for each question, adjusted by the respondent''s average deviation from the country mean in
  the answered questions.


  The LPI is constructed from the six indicators using principal component analysis (PCA), a standard
  statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. In the LPI, the inputs for PCA
  are country scores on questions 10-15, averaged across all respondents providing data on a given overseas
  market. Scores are normalized by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation
  before conducting PCA. The output from PCA is a single indicator - the LPI - that is a weighted average
  of those scores. The weights are chosen to maximize the percentage of variation in the LPI''s original
  six indicators. To construct the international LPI, normalized scores for each of the six original indicators
  are multiplied by their component loadings and then summed. The component loadings represent the weight
  given to each original indicator in constructing the international LPI. Since the loadings are similar
  for all six, the international LPI is close to a simple average of the indicators. To account for the
  sampling error created by the LPI''s survey-based dataset, LPI scores are presented with approximate
  80 percent confidence intervals.'

  Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The
  markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent''s country,
  random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international
  markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score
  using principal components analysis. Details of the survey methodology and index construction methodology
