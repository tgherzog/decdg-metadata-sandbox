Limitationsandexceptions: 'Because policymakers have tended to focus on fostering the growth of output,
  and because data on production are easier to collect than data on spending, many countries generate
  their primary estimate of GDP using the production approach. Moreover, many countries do not estimate
  all the components of national expenditures but instead derive some of the main aggregates indirectly
  using GDP (based on the production approach) as the control total.


  Data on exports and imports are compiled from customs reports and balance of payments data. Although
  the data from the payments side provide reasonably reliable records of cross-border transactions, they
  may not adhere strictly to the appropriate definitions of valuation and timing used in the balance of
  payments or corresponds to the change-of ownership criterion. This issue has assumed greater significance
  with the increasing globalization of international business. Neither customs nor balance of payments
  data usually capture the illegal transactions that occur in many countries. Goods carried by travelers
  across borders in legal but unreported shuttle trade may further distort trade statistics.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Gross domestic product (GDP) from the expenditure side is made up of
  household final consumption expenditure, general government final consumption expenditure, gross capital
  formation (private and public investment in fixed assets, changes in inventories, and net acquisitions
  of valuables), and net exports (exports minus imports) of goods and services. Such expenditures are
  recorded in purchaser prices and include net taxes on products.
