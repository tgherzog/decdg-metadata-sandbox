Limitationsandexceptions: 'Because policymakers have tended to focus on fostering the growth of output,
  and because data on production are easier to collect than data on spending, many countries generate
  their primary estimate of GDP using the production approach. Moreover, many countries do not estimate
  all the components of national expenditures but instead derive some of the main aggregates indirectly
  using GDP (based on the production approach) as the control total.


  Data on capital formation may be estimated from direct surveys of enterprises and administrative records
  or based on the commodity flow method using data from production, trade, and construction activities.
  The quality of data on government fixed capital formation depends on the quality of government accounting
  systems (which tend to be weak in developing countries). Measures of fixed capital formation by households
  and corporations - particularly capital outlays by small, unincorporated enterprises - are usually unreliable.


  Estimates of changes in inventories are rarely complete but usually include the most important activities
  or commodities. In some countries these estimates are derived as a composite residual along with household
  final consumption expenditure. According to national accounts conventions, adjustments should be made
  for appreciation of the value of inventory holdings due to price changes, but this is not always done.
  In highly inflationary economies this element can be substantial.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Gross domestic product (GDP) from the expenditure side is made up of
  household final consumption expenditure, general government final consumption expenditure, gross capital
  formation (private and public investment in fixed assets, changes in inventories, and net acquisitions
  of valuables), and net exports (exports minus imports) of goods and services. Such expenditures are
  recorded in purchaser prices and include net taxes on products.

description: Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions
  to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include
  land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and
  the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential
  dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to
  meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and "work in progress." According
  to the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation.
