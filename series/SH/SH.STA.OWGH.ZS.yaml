Generalcomments: "Estimates of overweight children are from national survey data. Once considered only
   a high-income economy problem, overweight children have become a growing concern in developing countries.
   Research shows an association between childhood obesity and a high prevalence of diabetes, respiratory
   disease, high blood pressure, and psychosocial and orthopedic disorders (de Onis and Bl\xF6ssner 2003).
   Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death, and disability in
   adulthood. In addition to increased future risks, obese children experience breathing difficulties
   and increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance,
   and psychological effects. Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate
   nutrition before birth and in infancy and early childhood. Many of these children are exposed to high-fat,
   high-sugar, high-salt, calorie-dense, micronutrient-poor foods, which tend be lower in cost than more
   nutritious foods. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with low levels of physical activity, result
   in sharp increases in childhood obesity, while under-nutrition continues."
