Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, and
  is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used
  to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts.

Limitationsandexceptions: In many developing countries a lack of precise information on the size of the
  cohort of one-year-old children makes immunization coverage difficult to estimate from program statistics.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Governments in developing countries usually finance immunization against
  measles and diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (DTP) as part of the basic public health
  package. The data shown here are based on an assessment of national immunization coverage rates by the
  WHO and UNICEF. The assessment considered both administrative data from service providers and household
  survey data on children''s immunization histories. Based on the data available, consideration of potential
  biases, and contributions of local experts, the most likely true level of immunization coverage was
  determined for each year.


  Notes on regional and global aggregates: When the vaccine is not introduced in a national immunization
  schedule, the missing value is assumed zero (or close to zero) in the relevant groups'' averages.'

description: Child immunization, measles, measures the percentage of children ages 12-23 months who received
  the measles vaccination before 12 months or at any time before the survey. A child is considered adequately
  immunized against measles after receiving one dose of vaccine.
