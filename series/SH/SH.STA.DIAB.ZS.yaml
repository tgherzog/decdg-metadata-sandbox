Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Diabetes, an important cause of ill health and a risk factor for other diseases
  in developed countries, is spreading rapidly in developing countries. Highest among the elderly, prevalence
  rates are rising among younger and productive populations in developing countries. Economic development
  has led to the spread of Western lifestyles and diet to developing countries, resulting in a substantial
  increase in diabetes. Without effective prevention and control programs, diabetes will likely continue
  to increase.

Limitationsandexceptions: The limited availability of data on health status is a major constraint in assessing
  the health situation in developing countries. Surveillance data are lacking for many major public health
  concerns. Estimates of prevalence and incidence are available for some diseases but are often unreliable
  and incomplete. National health authorities differ widely in capacity and willingness to collect or
  report information.
