Limitationsandexceptions: The limited availability of data on health status is a major constraint in assessing
  the health situation in developing countries. Surveillance data are lacking for many major public health
  concerns. Estimates of prevalence and incidence are available for some diseases but are often unreliable
  and incomplete. National health authorities differ widely in capacity and willingness to collect or
  report information. To compensate for this and improve reliability and international comparability,
  the World Health Organization (WHO) prepares estimates in accordance with epidemiological models and
  statistical standards.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on cause of death are compiled by the WHO, based mainly on data
  from national vital registry systems, as well as sample registration systems, population laboratories,
  and epidemiological analysis of specific conditions. Data are classified based on the International
  Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision. Data have been carefully
  analyzed to take into account incomplete coverage of vital registration and the likely differences in
  cause of death patterns that would be expected in under-covered and often poorer subpopulations. Special
  attention has also been paid to misattribution or miscoding of causes of death in cardiovascular diseases,
  cancer, injuries, and general ill-defined categories. For further information, consult the original
  source.
