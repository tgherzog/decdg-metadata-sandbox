description: Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while
  pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated
  with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths
  in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP measured using purchasing power parities (PPPs).
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Generalcomments: This indicator represents the risk associated with each pregnancy and is also a Sustainable
  Development Goal Indicator (3.1.1) for monitoring maternal health.

Limitationsandexceptions: The methodology differs from that used for previous estimates, so data should
  not be compared historically. Maternal mortality ratios are generally of unknown reliability, as are
  many other cause-specific mortality indicators. The ratios cannot be assumed to provide an exact estimate
  of maternal mortality.
Notesfromoriginalsource: 'Estimates of maternal mortality are presented along with upper and lower  limits
  of intervals (see footnote) designed to depict the uncertainty of estimates. The intervals are the product
  of a detailed probabilistic evaluation of the uncertainty attributable to the various components of
  the estimation process. For estimates derived from the multilevel regression model, the components of
  uncertainty were divided into two groups: those reflected within the regression model (internal sources),
  and those due to assumptions or calculations that occur outside the model (external sources). Estimates
  of the total uncertainty reflect a combination of these various sources.'
Periodicity: Annual

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Reproductive health is a state of physical and mental well-being in
  relation to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Means of achieving reproductive
  health include education and services during pregnancy and childbirth, safe and effective contraception,
  and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth
  are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries.


  Maternal mortality is generally of unknown reliability, as are many other cause-specific mortality indicators.
  Household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys attempt to measure maternal mortality by asking
  respondents about survivorship of sisters. The main disadvantage of this method is that the estimates
  of maternal mortality that it produces pertain to any time within the past few years before the survey,
  making them unsuitable for monitoring recent changes or observing the impact of interventions. In addition,
  measurement of maternal mortality is subject to many types of errors. Even in high-income countries
  with reliable vital registration systems, misclassification of maternal deaths has been found to lead
  to serious underestimation.


  The estimates are based on an exercise by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG)
  which consists of World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children''s Fund (UNICEF), World Bank,
  and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and include country-level time series data. For countries
  without complete registration data but with other types of data and for countries with no data, maternal
  mortality is estimated with a regression model using available national maternal mortality data and
  socioeconomic information.'
