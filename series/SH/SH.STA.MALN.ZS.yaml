Generalcomments: Undernourished children have lower resistance to infection and are more likely to die
  from common childhood ailments such as diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. Frequent illness
  saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness
  and faltering growth (UNICEF, www.childinfo.org). Estimates are from national survey data. Being even
  mildly underweight increases the risk of death and inhibits cognitive development in children. And it
  perpetuates the problem across generations, as malnourished women are more likely to have low-birth-weight
  babies. Stunting, or being below median height for age, is often used as a proxy for multifaceted deprivation
  and as an indicator of long-term changes in malnutrition.

description: Prevalence of underweight children is the percentage of children under age 5 whose weight
  for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population
  ages 0-59 months. The data are based on the WHO's child growth standards released in 2006.
