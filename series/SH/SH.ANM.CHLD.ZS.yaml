description: Prevalence of anemia, children ages 6-59 months, is the percentage of children ages 6-59
  months whose hemoglobin level is less than 110 grams per liter, adjusted for altitude.
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Generalcomments: Anemia is defined as a low blood haemoglobin concentration. Anaemia may result from a
  number of causes, with the most significant contributor being iron deficiency. Anaemia resulting from
  iron deficiency adversely affects cognitive and motor development and causes fatigue and low productivity.
  Children under age 5 and pregnant women have the highest risk for anemia.

Limitationsandexceptions: Data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other
  nutritional indicators such as hild anthropometry. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full
  variation across countries and regions.
Periodicity: Annual

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "Data on anemia are compiled by the WHO, and a statistical model was
   used to estimate trends. WHO\u2019s hemoglobin threshold concentration in blood was used."
