Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Health systems - the combined arrangements of institutions and actions
  whose primary purpose is to promote, restore, or maintain health (World Health Organization, World Health
  Report 2000) - are increasingly being recognized as key to combating disease and improving the health
  status of populations. The World Bank''s Healthy Development: Strategy for Health, Nutrition, and Population
  Results emphasizes the need to strengthen health systems, which are weak in many countries, in order
  to increase the effectiveness of programs aimed at reducing specific diseases and further reduce morbidity
  and mortality. To evaluate health systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that
  key components - such as financing, service delivery, workforce, governance, and information - be monitored
  using several key indicators. The data are a subset of the key indicators. Monitoring health systems
  allows the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of different health system models to be compared. Health
  system data also help identify weaknesses and strengths and areas that need investment, such as additional
  health facilities, better health information systems, or better trained human resources.


  Availability and use of health services, such as hospital beds per 1,000 people, reflect both demand-
  and supply-side factors. In the absence of a consistent definition this is a crude indicator of the
  extent of physical, financial, and other barriers to health care.'
