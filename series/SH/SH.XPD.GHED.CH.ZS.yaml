Developmentrelevance: Strengthening health financing is one objective of Sustainable Development Goal
  3 (SDG target 3.c).  The levels and trends of health expenditure data identify key issues such as weaknesses
  and strengths and areas that need investment, for instance additional health facilities, better health
  information systems, or better trained human resources.  Health financing is also critical for reaching
  universal health coverage (UHC) defined as all people obtaining the quality health services they need
  without suffering financial hardship (SDG 3.8).  The data on out-of-pocket spending is a key indicator
  with regard to financial protection and hence of progress towards UHC.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: The health expenditure estimates have been prepared by the World Health
  Organization under the framework of the System of Health Accounts 2011 (SHA 2011).  The Health SHA 2011
  tracks all health spending in a given country over a defined period of time regardless of the entity
  or institution that financed and managed that spending. It generates consistent and comprehensive data
  on health spending in a country, which in turn can contribute to evidence-based policy-making.
