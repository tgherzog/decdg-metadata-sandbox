Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Generalcomments: In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women
  being especially vulnerable.

Limitationsandexceptions: The limited availability of data on health status is a major constraint in assessing
  the health situation in developing countries. Surveillance data are lacking for many major public health
  concerns. Estimates of prevalence and incidence are available for some diseases but are often unreliable
  and incomplete. National health authorities differ widely in capacity and willingness to collect or
  report information.
Periodicity: Annual
Source: UNAIDS estimates.
Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'HIV prevalence rates reflect the rate of HIV infection in each country''s
  population. Low national prevalence rates can be misleading, however. They often disguise epidemics
  that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over
  into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with
  young women especially vulnerable.


  Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Changes in procedures
  and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved
  estimates of HIV and AIDS. The models, which are routinely updated, track the course of HIV epidemics
  and their impact, making full use of information in HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as
  well as survey data. The models take into account reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral
  therapy (which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live
  longer) and allow for changes in urbanization over time in generalized epidemics. The estimates include
  plausibility bounds, which reflect the certainty associated with each of the estimates.'
