description: 'Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that
  is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during
  a specified period.'
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: Estimates of women in the labor force and employment are generally lower than those
  of men and are not comparable internationally, reflecting that demographic, social, legal, and cultural
  trends and norms determine whether women's activities are regarded as economic. In many low-income countries
  women often work on farms or in other family enterprises without pay, and others work in or near their
  homes, mixing work and family activities during the day. In many high-income economies, women have been
  increasingly acquiring higher education that has led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather
  than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. However, access to good- paying occupations for women remains
  unequal in many occupations and countries around the world. Labor force statistics by gender is important
  to monitor gender disparities in employment and unemployment patterns.
Generalcomments: National estimates are also available in the WDI database. Caution should be used when
  comparing ILO estimates with national estimates.

Limitationsandexceptions: 'Data on the labor force are compiled by the ILO from labor force surveys, censuses,
  and establishment censuses and surveys. For some countries a combination of these sources is used. Labor
  force surveys are the most comprehensive source for internationally comparable labor force data. They
  can cover all non-institutionalized civilians, all branches and sectors of the economy, and all categories
  of workers, including people holding multiple jobs. By contrast, labor force data from population censuses
  are often based on a limited number of questions on the economic characteristics of individuals, with
  little scope to probe. The resulting data often differ from labor force survey data and vary considerably
  by country, depending on the census scope and coverage. Establishment censuses and surveys provide data
  only on the employed population, not unemployed workers, workers in small establishments, or workers
  in the informal sector.


  The reference period of a census or survey is another important source of differences: in some countries
  data refer to people''s status on the day of the census or survey or during a specific period before
  the inquiry date, while in others data are recorded without reference to any period. In countries, where
  the household is the basic unit of production and all members contribute to output, but some at low
  intensity or irregularly, the estimated labor force may be much smaller than the numbers actually working.


  Differing definitions of employment age also affect comparability. For most countries the working age
  is 15 and older, but in some countries children younger than 15 work full- or part-time and are included
  in the estimates. Similarly, some countries have an upper age limit. As a result, calculations may systematically
  over- or underestimate actual rates.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The labor force is the supply of labor available for producing goods
  and services in an economy. It includes people who are currently employed and people who are unemployed
  but seeking work as well as first-time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included, however. Unpaid
  workers, family workers, and students are often omitted, and some countries do not count members of
  the armed forces. Labor force size tends to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave.
  


  The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and
  over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific
  factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other
  sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.'
