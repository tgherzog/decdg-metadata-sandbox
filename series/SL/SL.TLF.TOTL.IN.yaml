Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "The labor force is the supply of labor available for producing goods\
  \ and services in an economy. It includes people who are currently employed and people who are unemployed\
  \ but seeking work as well as first-time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included, however. Unpaid\
  \ workers, family workers, and students are often omitted, and some countries do not count members of\
  \ the armed forces. Labor force size tends to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave.\
  \ \n\nData are generated with World Bank population estimates and ILO estimates on labor force participation\
  \ rate. The ILO estimates are harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting\
  \ for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors.\
  \ The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other sources\
  \ (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available."
