Developmentrelevance: 'Labor productivity is used to assess a country''s economic ability to create and
  sustain decent employment opportunities with fair and equitable remuneration. Productivity increases
  obtained through investment, trade, technological progress, or changes in work organization can increase
  social protection and reduce poverty, which in turn reduce vulnerable employment and working poverty.
  Productivity increases do not guarantee these improvements, but without them - and the economic growth
  they bring - improvements are highly unlikely.


  GDP per person employed is a key measure to monitor whether a country is on track to achieve the Sustainable
  Development Goal of promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive
  employment and decent work for all. [SDG Indicator 8.2.1]'

Limitationsandexceptions: For comparability of individual sectors labor productivity is estimated according
  to national accounts conventions. However, there are still significant limitations on the availability
  of reliable data. Information on consistent series of output in both national currencies and purchasing
  power parity dollars is not easily available, especially in developing countries, because the definition,
  coverage, and methodology are not always consistent across countries. For example, countries employ
  different methodologies for estimating the missing values for the nonmarket service sectors and use
  different definitions of the informal sector.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "GDP per person employed represents labor productivity \u2014 output\
  \ per unit of labor input. To compare labor productivity levels across countries, GDP is converted to\
  \ international dollars using purchasing power parity rates which take account of differences in relative\
  \ prices between countries."

description: GDP per person employed is gross domestic product (GDP) divided by total employment in the
  economy. Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP is GDP converted to 2017 constant international dollars using
  PPP rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP that a U.S. dollar has in
  the United States.
