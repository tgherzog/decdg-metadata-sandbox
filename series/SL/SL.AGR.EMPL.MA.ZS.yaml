description: Employment is defined as persons of working age who were engaged in any activity to produce
  goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period or not at work
  due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangement. The agriculture sector consists
  of activities in agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing, in accordance with division 1 (ISIC 2)
  or categories A-B (ISIC 3) or category A (ISIC 4).
Aggregationmethod: Weighted average
Developmentrelevance: 'Sectoral information is particularly useful in identifying broad shifts in employment
  and stages of development. In the textbook case of economic development, labour flows from agriculture
  and other labour-intensive primary activities to industry and finally to the services sector; in the
  process, workers migrate from rural to urban areas.


  The breakdown of the indicator by sex allows for analysis of gender segregation of employment by specific
  sector. Women may be drawn into lower-paying service activities that allow for more flexible work schedules
  thus making it easier to balance family responsibilities with work life. Segregation of women in certain
  sectors may also result from cultural attitudes that prevent them from entering industrial employment.

  Segregating one sex in a narrow range of occupations significantly reduces economic efficiency by reducing
  labor market flexibility and thus the economy''s ability to adapt to change. This segregation is particularly
  harmful for women, who have a much narrower range of labor market choices and lower levels of pay than
  men. But it is also detrimental to men when job losses are concentrated in industries dominated by men
  and job growth is centered in service occupations, where women have better chances, as has been the
  recent experience in many countries.'

Limitationsandexceptions: 'There are many differences in how countries define and measure employment status,
  particularly members of the armed forces, self-employed workers, and unpaid family workers. Where members
  of the armed forces are included, they are allocated to the service sector, causing that sector to be
  somewhat overstated relative to the service sector in economies where they are excluded. Where data
  are obtained from establishment surveys, data cover only employees; thus self-employed and unpaid family
  workers are excluded. In such cases the employment share of the agricultural sector is severely underreported.
  Caution should be also used where the data refer only to urban areas, which record little or no agricultural
  work. Moreover, the age group and area covered could differ by country or change over time within a
  country. For detailed information, consult the original source.


  Countries also take different approaches to the treatment of unemployed people. In most countries unemployed
  people with previous job experience are classified according to their last job. But in some countries
  the unemployed and people seeking their first job are not classifiable by economic activity. Because
  of these differences, the size and distribution of employment by economic activity may not be fully
  comparable across countries.


  The ILO reports data by major divisions of the ISIC revision 2, revision 3, or revision 4. Broad classification
  such as employment by agriculture, industry, and services may obscure fundamental shifts within countries''
  industrial patterns. A slight majority of countries report economic activity according to the ISIC revision
  3 instead of revision 2 or revision 4. The use of one classification or the other should not have a
  significant impact on the information for the employment of the three broad sectorsdata.'

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The International Labour Organization (ILO) classifies economic activity
  using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) of All Economic Activities, revision
  2 (1968), revision 3 (1990), and revision 4 (2008). Because this classification is based on where work
  is performed (industry) rather than type of work performed (occupation), all of an enterprise''s employees
  are classified under the same industry, regardless of their trade or occupation. The categories should
  sum to 100 percent. Where they do not, the differences are due to workers who are not classified by
  economic activity.


  The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and
  over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific
  factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other
  sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.'
