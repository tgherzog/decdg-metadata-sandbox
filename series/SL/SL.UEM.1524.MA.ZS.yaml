Developmentrelevance: 'Paradoxically, low unemployment rates can disguise substantial poverty in a country,
  while high unemployment rates can occur in countries with a high level of economic development and low
  rates of poverty. In countries without unemployment or welfare benefits people eke out a living in vulnerable
  employment. In countries with well-developed safety nets workers can afford to wait for suitable or
  desirable jobs. But high and sustained unemployment indicates serious inefficiencies in resource allocation.


  Youth unemployment is an important policy issue for many economies. Young men and women today face increasing
  uncertainty in their hopes of undergoing a satisfactory transition in the labour market, and this uncertainty
  and disillusionment can, in turn, have damaging effects on individuals, communities, economies and society
  at large. Unemployed or underemployed youth are less able to contribute effectively to national development
  and have fewer opportunities to exercise their rights as citizens. They have less to spend as consumers,
  less to invest as savers and often have no "voice" to bring about change in their lives and communities.
  Widespread youth unemployment and underemployment also prevents companies and countries from innovating
  and developing competitive advantages based on human capital investment, thus undermining future prospects.


  Unemployment is a key measure to monitor whether a country is on track to achieve the Sustainable Development
  Goal of promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment
  and decent work for all. [SDG Indicator 8.5.2]'

Limitationsandexceptions: "The criteria for people considered to be seeking work, and the treatment of\
  \ people temporarily laid off or seeking work for the first time, vary across countries. In many cases\
  \ it is especially difficult to measure employment and unemployment in agriculture. The timing of a\
  \ survey can maximize the effects of seasonal unemployment in agriculture. And informal sector employment\
  \ is difficult to quantify where informal activities are not tracked.\n\nThere may be also persons not\
  \ currently in the labour market who want to work but do not actively \"seek\" work because they view\
  \ job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination,\
  \ or structural, social or cultural barriers. The exclusion of people who want to work but are not seeking\
  \ work (often called the \"hidden unemployed\" or \"discouraged workers\") is a criterion that will\
  \ affect the unemployment count of both women and men. \n\nHowever, women tend to be excluded from the\
  \ count for various reasons. Women suffer more from discrimination and from structural, social, and\
  \ cultural barriers that impede them from seeking work. Also, women are often responsible for the care\
  \ of children and the elderly and for household affairs. They may not be available for work during the\
  \ short reference period, as they need to make arrangements before starting work. Further, women are\
  \ considered to be employed when they are working part-time or in temporary jobs, despite the instability\
  \ of these jobs or their active search for more secure employment."

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: "The standard definition of unemployed persons is those individuals\
  \ without work, seeking work in a recent past period, and currently available for work, including people\
  \ who have lost their jobs or who have voluntarily left work. Persons who did not look for work but\
  \ have an arrangements for a future job are also counted as unemployed. \n\nSome unemployment is unavoidable.\
  \ At any time some workers are temporarily unemployed between jobs as employers look for the right workers\
  \ and workers search for better jobs. It is the labour force or the economically active portion of the\
  \ population that serves as the base for this indicator, not the total population.\n\nThe series is\
  \ part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time\
  \ by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific\
  \ factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other\
  \ sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are\
  \ available."
