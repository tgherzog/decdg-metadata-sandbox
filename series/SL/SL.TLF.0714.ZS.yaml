description: Children in employment refer to children involved in economic activity for at least one hour
  in the reference week of the survey.
Developmentrelevance: In most countries more boys are involved in employment, or the gender difference
  is small. However, girls are often more present in hidden or underreported forms of employment such
  as domestic service, and in almost all societies girls bear greater responsibility for household chores
  in their own homes, work that lies outside the System of National Accounts production boundary and is
  thus not considered in estimates of children's employment.

Limitationsandexceptions: Although efforts are made to harmonize the definition of employment and the
  questions on employment in survey questionnaires, significant differences remain in the survey instruments
  that collect data on children in employment and in the sampling design underlying the surveys. Differences
  exist not only across different household surveys in the same country but also across the same type
  of survey carried out in different countries, so estimates of working children are not fully comparable
  across countries. For detailed source information, see footnotes at each data point.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'Data are from household surveys by the International Labor Organization
  (ILO), the United Nations Children''s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and national statistical offices.
  The surveys yield data on education, employment, health, expenditure, and consumption indicators related
  to children''s work. Since children''s work is captured in the sense of "economic activity," the data
  refer to children in employment, a broader concept than child labor (see ILO 2009a for details on this
  distinction).


  Household survey data generally include information on work type - for example, whether a child is working
  for payment in cash or in kind or is involved in unpaid work, working for someone who is not a member
  of the household, or involved in any type of family work (on the farm or in a business).


  In line with the definition of economic activity adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians, the threshold set by the 1993 UN System of National Accounts for classifying a person
  as employed is to have been engaged at least one hour in any activity relating to the production of
  goods and services during the reference period. Children seeking work are thus excluded. Economic activity
  covers all market production and certain nonmarket production, including production of goods for own
  use. It excludes unpaid household services (commonly called "household chores") - that is, the production
  of domestic and personal services by household members for a household''s own consumption.


  Country surveys define the ages for child labor as 5-17. The data here have been recalculated to present
  statistics for children ages 7-14.'
