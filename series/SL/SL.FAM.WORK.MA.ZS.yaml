Developmentrelevance: "Breaking down employment information by status in employment provides a statistical\
  \ basis for describing workers' behaviour and conditions of work, and for defining an individual's socio-economic\
  \ group. A high proportion of wage and salaried workers in a country can signify advanced economic development.\
  \ If the proportion of own-account workers (self-employed without hired employees) is sizeable, it may\
  \ be an indication of a large agriculture sector and low growth in the formal economy. A high proportion\
  \ of contributing family workers \u2014 generally unpaid, although compensation might come indirectly\
  \ in the form of family income \u2014 may indicate weak development, little job growth, and often a\
  \ large rural economy.\n\nEach status group faces different economic risks, and contributing family\
  \ workers and own-account workers are the most vulnerable - and therefore the most likely to fall into\
  \ poverty. They are the least likely to have formal work arrangements, are the least likely to have\
  \ social protection and safety nets to guard against economic shocks, and often are incapable of generating\
  \ sufficient savings to offset these shocks."

Limitationsandexceptions: Data are drawn from labor force surveys and household surveys, supplemented
  by official estimates and censuses for a small group of countries. Due to differences in definitions
  and coverage across countries, there are limitations for comparing data across countries and over time
  even within a country. Estimates of women in employment are not comparable internationally, reflecting
  that demographic, social, legal, and cultural trends and norms determine whether women's activities
  are regarded as economic.

Statisticalconceptandmethodology: 'The indicator of status in employment distinguishes between two categories
  of the total employed. These are: (a) wage and salaried workers (also known as employees); and (b) self-employed
  workers. Self-employed group is broken down in the subcategories: self-employed workers with employees
  (employers), self-employed workers without employees (own-account workers), members of producers'' cooperatives
  and contributing family workers (also known as unpaid family workers). Vulnerable employment refers
  to the sum of contributing family workers and own-account workers.


  The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and
  over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific
  factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other
  sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.'
