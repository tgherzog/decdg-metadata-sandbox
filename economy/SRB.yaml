SpecialNotes: Montenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro on June 3, 2006. Where available,
  data for each country are shown separately. However, for Serbia, some indicators, such as those series
  for which data appear only for Serbia and not Montenegro--e.g., aid, environment, external debt, balance
  of payments, various social indicators excluding population--continue to include data for Montenegro
  through 2005. Moreover, data from 1999 onward for Serbia for most indicators exclude data for Kosovo,
  1999 being the year when Kosovo became a territory under international administration pursuant to UN
  Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999); any exceptions are noted. Kosovo became a World Bank member
  on June 29, 2009; available data are shown separately for Kosovo. In 2011, the Statistical Office of
  Serbia improved the methodology of national accounts data for 2003 onward. Specifically, the classification
  of sectors was revised.
