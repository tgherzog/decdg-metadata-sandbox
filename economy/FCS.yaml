LongName: Fragile and conflict affected situations
SpecialNotes: 'Fragile and conflict-affected situations aggregate, based on the FY21 FCS list.


  Countries are distinguished based on the nature and severity of issues they face. The classification
  uses the following categories:

  - Countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on publicly available
  indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions and manifestations of fragility.

  - Countries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related
  deaths relative to the population. This category includes two sub-categories based on the intensity
  of violence: countries in high-intensity conflict and countries in medium-intensity conflict.
